> [!Abstract]
>
> This article presents a classroom experiment that compared a strategy developed by a team of MBA students in the traditional way with one developed using a virtual AI assistant, which was an interactive tool that linked a tried-and-tested strategy toolkit as a plug-in to the generative AI underlying Chat GPT. The results of the two independent processes were largely similar, with the AI-assisted strategy being, if anything, more original. The difference? The students took a week and the AI just 60 minutes.

# Notes
Summary by chat GPT
>**Hypothesis:**
> The hypothesis of the text is that generative AI, like ChatGPT, can significantly contribute to strategic innovation in business, potentially matching or surpassing human capabilities in strategy-making. This includes the belief that AI can integrate with existing strategic frameworks (like the Blue Ocean Framework) to provide original, effective solutions and insights for business challenges.
> 
> **Method:**  
> The method involved connecting ChatGPT to the Blue Ocean Framework, a well-established strategic tool. This experiment sought to test the AI's capability to generate innovative business strategies. The AI was tasked with addressing a specific strategic challenge: establishing a bagel bakery in Paris. The AI's suggestions were based on identifying non-customers and creating a value proposition to attract them. Additionally, the AI mapped the ecosystem, including potential suppliers, distribution channels, and customer segments. The results of the AI's strategy-making were then compared to those developed by a group of MBA students using traditional methods.
> 
> **Findings:**  
> The findings revealed that the AI-generated strategies were not only comparable to those created by human MBA students but, in some aspects, more original and time-efficient. The AI completed the strategic process in about an hour, while the human team took a week. The AI suggested innovative approaches like offering limited items for short periods and targeting specific customer segments. The comparison highlighted the potential of AI in strategic thinking and its ability to complement human strategists. The text concludes by suggesting that AI can enhance human productivity in strategy-making, leading to more inclusive and sustainable business models and strategies.
