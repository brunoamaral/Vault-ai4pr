In addition, the identification of psychotropic plant cannabinoids has led to more studies regarding the cannabinoid system and its therapeutic features in the treatment and management of clinical symptoms of neuroinflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinsons disease (PD), and Alzheimers disease (AD). In fact, cannabinoid agonists are able to control and regulate inflammatory responses. In contrast to the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and its unwanted adverse effects, the cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) and its ligands hold promise for new and effective therapeutic approaches. So far, some successes have been achieved in this field. This review will discuss an outline of the endocannabinoid system's involvement in neuroinflammatory disorders. Moreover, the pharmacological efficacy of different natural and synthetic preparations of phytocannabinoids acting on cannabinoid receptors, particularly in MS, PD, and AD, will be updated. Also, the reasons for targeting CB2 for neurodegeneration will be explained.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Abd‐Nikfarjam","given":"Bahareh"},{"family":"Dolati‐Somarin","given":"Amirhossein"},{"family":"Baradaran Rahimi","given":"Vafa"},{"family":"Askari","given":"Vahid Reza"}],"citation-key":"abd-nikfarjamCannabinoidsNeuroinflammatoryDisorders2023","container-title":"BioFactors","container-title-short":"BioFactors","DOI":"10.1002/biof.1936","ISSN":"0951-6433, 1872-8081","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"en","page":"560-583","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cannabinoids in neuroinflammatory disorders: Focusing on multiple sclerosis, Parkinsons, and Alzheimers diseases","title-short":"Cannabinoids in neuroinflammatory disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/biof.1936","volume":"49"},{"id":"abdelgawadMesenchymalStemCellbased2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. The virus causes an exaggerated immune response, resulting in a cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the leading cause of COVID-19-related mortality and morbidity. So far, no therapies have succeeded in circumventing the exacerbated immune response or cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), through their immunomodulatory and regenerative activities, mostly mediated by their paracrine effect and extracellular vesicle production, have therapeutic potential in many autoimmune, inflammatory, and degenerative diseases. In this paper, we review clinical studies on the use of MSCs for COVID-19 treatment, including the salutary effects of MSCs on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and the immunomodulation of the cytokine storm. Ongoing clinical trial designs, cell sources, dose and administration, and populations are summarized, and the paracrine mode of benefit is discussed. We also offer suggestions for optimizing MSC-based therapies, including genetic engineering, strategies for cell surface modification, nanotechnology applications, and combination therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdelgawad","given":"Mai"},{"family":"Bakry","given":"Nourhan Saied"},{"family":"Farghali","given":"Ahmed A."},{"family":"Abdel-Latif","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Lotfy","given":"Ahmed"}],"citation-key":"abdelgawadMesenchymalStemCellbased2021","container-title":"Stem Cell Research & Therapy","container-title-short":"Stem Cell Res Ther","DOI":"10.1186/s13287-021-02542-z","ISSN":"1757-6512","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,21]]},"language":"en","page":"469","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy and exosomes in COVID-19: current trends and prospects","title-short":"Mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy and exosomes in COVID-19","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-021-02542-z","volume":"12"},{"id":"abdelrazekExploringEffectGlatiramer2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"AbdelRazek","given":"Mahmoud A."},{"family":"Tummala","given":"Subhash"},{"family":"Khalid","given":"Fariha"},{"family":"Tauhid","given":"Shahamat"},{"family":"Jalkh","given":"Youmna"},{"family":"Khalil","given":"Samar"},{"family":"Hurwitz","given":"Shelley"},{"family":"Zurawski","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Bakshi","given":"Rohit"}],"citation-key":"abdelrazekExploringEffectGlatiramer2023","container-title":"Journal of the Neurological Sciences","container-title-short":"Journal of the Neurological Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.jns.2022.120501","ISSN":"0022510X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","page":"120501","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Exploring the effect of glatiramer acetate on cerebral gray matter atrophy in multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022510X2200363X","volume":"444"},{"id":"abdiMetforminTherapyAttenuates2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdi","given":"Mahdad"},{"family":"Pasbakhsh","given":"Parichehr"},{"family":"Shabani","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Nekoonam","given":"Saied"},{"family":"Sadeghi","given":"Asie"},{"family":"Fathi","given":"Fardin"},{"family":"Abouzaripour","given":"Morteza"},{"family":"Mohamed","given":"Wael"},{"family":"Zibara","given":"Kazem"},{"family":"Kashani","given":"Iraj Ragerdi"},{"family":"Zendedel","given":"Adib"}],"citation-key":"abdiMetforminTherapyAttenuates2021","container-title":"Neurotoxicity Research","container-title-short":"Neurotox Res","DOI":"10.1007/s12640-021-00417-y","ISSN":"1029-8428, 1476-3524","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1732-1746","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Metformin Therapy Attenuates Pro-inflammatory Microglia by Inhibiting NF-κB in Cuprizone Demyelinating Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12640-021-00417-y","volume":"39"},{"id":"abdolmalekiCellTherapyProcedure2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Macrophage M2 (MP2)‐based cell therapy is a novel medicinal treatment for animals with Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an experimental model of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Cell therapy procedure using MP2 can potentially alleviate the\n              Clinical Scores\n              Index and correct the motor defects in Recovery phase of EAE animals. In healthy mice, the brain and myelin surrounding neurons are in a healthy and physiological state (1). To evaluate MS in humans, it is necessary to model this type of disease in animals using EAE procedure through subcutaneous injection of CFA, MOG\n              35–55\n              , MT, and Pert. Thus, inflammation and autoimmunity occur, which finally lead to myelin destruction and motor symptoms (2). By aspiration of progenitor cells available in bone marrow, the MP2 can be isolated and cultured. By activation of these types of cells, a rich collection of MP2 can be prepared for the cell‐therapy process (3). After injection through the tail vein or intra‐peritoneal procedure, these cells can be located in CNS through crossing from the BBB. They begin their anti‐inflammatory activities and help repair the damaged myelin (4). Eventually, the clinical symptoms can be modified considerably, and the animal motor function improves (5).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Studies were identified by electronic search of Cochrane register, Embase, Medline, Scopus (last search on 11 November 2016). RESULTS: After screening 8469 articles, two randomized controlled trials and one open label study enrolling a total of 426 patients, were included. Cannabinoids relevantly decreased incontinence episodes in all three studies. Pooling data showed mean difference in incontinence episodes per 24 hours to be -0.35 (95% confidence interval -0.46 to -0.24). Mild adverse events were frequent (38-100%), but only two patients (0.7%) reported a serious adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data imply, that cannabinoids might be an effective and safe treatment option for NULTD in patients with MS. However, evidence base is poor and more high-quality, well-designed, adequately powered and sampled studies are urgently needed to reach definitive conclusions.

Here, we review and summarise the pre-clinical evidence, both in vitro and in vivo, in support of the therapeutic potential of inhibiting H3K27-targeting demethylases, with a focus on the small-molecule inhibitor GSK-J4. In malignancies, KDM6A/B inhibition possesses the ability to inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis, promote differentiation, and heighten sensitivity to currently employed chemotherapeutics. KDM6A/B inhibition also comprises a potent anti-inflammatory approach in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders associated with inappropriately exuberant inflammatory and autoimmune responses, restoring immunological homeostasis to inflamed tissues. With respect to infectious diseases, KDM6A/B inhibition can suppress the growth of infectious pathogens and attenuate the immunopathology precipitated by these pathogens.

Only peer-reviewed journal articles that are published between October 2010 and December 2018 were sought in central and journal databases. Studies were selected based on predefined criteria and assessed for risk of bias and quality of evidence using GRADE. One thousand eight hundred fifty-six studies were the outcome of the search, out of which 9 meets all eligible criteria. Of the 9 studies, three-quarter was published between 2017 and 2018, covering five continents: (North America: 3; Asia: 2; Australia: 2; South America: 1, Europe: 1). The final included studies broadly examined young Instagram users between the age of 19 and 35. The synthesis affirmed a linkage between Instagram and symptoms of depression or depressive behaviour. Variables that moderate this relationship are social comparison, self-esteem built on validation and approval of others, social media dependence, gender, negative or insufficient feedback, poor self-rated attractiveness, Instagram broadcasting and loneliness, younger users and risk of anxiety, and the number of strangers that users follow. There is a strong relationship between Instagram use and mental health disorders such as depression or depressive behaviour; however, no in-depth direct causality is proven yet. Further studies are needed to unravel the direct causality puzzles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Adeyanju","given":"Gbadebo Collins"},{"family":"Solfa","given":"Ron Patrick"},{"family":"Tran","given":"Thuy Linh"},{"family":"Wohlfarth","given":"Sophia"},{"family":"Büttner","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Osobajo","given":"Oluyomi A."},{"family":"Otitoju","given":"Afolabi"}],"citation-key":"adeyanjuBehaviouralSymptomsMental2021","container-title":"Translational Medicine Communications","container-title-short":"transl med commun","DOI":"10.1186/s41231-021-00092-3","ISSN":"2396-832X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,7]]},"language":"en","page":"15","source":"Springer Link","title":"Behavioural symptoms of mental health disorder such as depression among young people using Instagram: a systematic review","title-short":"Behavioural symptoms of mental health disorder such as depression among young people using Instagram","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41231-021-00092-3","volume":"6"},{"id":"affraldrReviewOligodendrocytesNeuronal2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Affrald R","given":"Jino"},{"family":"Narayan","given":"Shoba"}],"citation-key":"affraldrReviewOligodendrocytesNeuronal2024","container-title":"International Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"International Journal of Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1080/00207454.2024.2362200","ISSN":"0020-7454, 1543-5245","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,20]]},"language":"en","page":"1-22","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A review: oligodendrocytes in neuronal axonal conduction and methods for enhancing their performance","title-short":"A review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00207454.2024.2362200"},{"id":"aglandsCanStressManagement2018","abstract":"Background: Despite evidence of perceived stress as a risk factor for multiple sclerosis activity, the evidence for managing stress is limited.

Traditional therapies are often limited by systemic side effects, immunosuppression,\nand lack of long-term efficacy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have demonstrated immunomodulatory\nproperties, primarily through the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are now\nrecognized as potent mediators of immune regulation. MSC-derived EVs carry bioactive molecules\nsuch as microRNAs, proteins, and lipids that influence key immune pathways, making them a promising\ntherapeutic avenue for autoimmune diseases. This review critically examines the immunomodulatory\nmechanisms of MSC-derived EVs, focusing on their role in regulating T cells, B cells,\nand macrophages, which are central to autoimmune pathology. We explore recent preclinical and\nclinical studies that highlight the ability of MSC-derived EVs to reduce inflammation, promote immune\ntolerance, and restore tissue homeostasis in autoimmune settings. Furthermore, we discuss the\nadvantages of EV-based therapy over MSC-based therapies, including improved safety profiles, lower\nimmunogenicity, and scalability for clinical application. By evaluating the current landscape of\nMSC-derived EV research, we identify key gaps and propose innovative strategies to optimize EVbased\ntherapies for autoimmune diseases. These strategies include engineering EVs to enhance their\nspecificity and therapeutic efficacy, as well as integrating them with biomaterials for targeted delivery.\nOur review aims to provide a forward-looking perspective on the potential of MSC-derived EVs\nas a novel therapeutic approach, moving beyond traditional cell-based therapies to offer more precise\nand personalized treatment options for autoimmune diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahad Mir","given":"Prince"},{"family":"Hussain","given":"Md Sadique"},{"family":"Ahmad Khanday","given":"Murtaza"},{"family":"Mohi-ud-din","given":"Roohi"},{"family":"Pottoo","given":"Faheem Hyder"},{"family":"Hasssan Mir","given":"Reyaz"}],"citation-key":"ahadmirImmunomodulatoryRolesMesenchymal2024","container-title":"Current Stem Cell Research & Therapy","container-title-short":"CSCR","DOI":"10.2174/011574888X341781241216044130","ISSN":"1574888X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,27]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Immunomodulatory Roles of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles: A Promising Therapeutic Approach for Autoimmune Diseases","title-short":"Immunomodulatory Roles of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.eurekaselect.com/237737/article","volume":"20"},{"id":"ahmadHigherProportionErminimmunopositive2021","abstract":"Incomplete remyelination is frequent in multiple sclerosis (MS)-lesions, but there is no established marker for recent remyelination.

The density of ermin+ oligodendrocytes in the brain was significantly decreased after one week of CPZ exposure (p < 0.02). The relative proportion of ermin+ cells compared to cells positive for the late-stage oligodendrocyte marker Nogo-A increased at the onset of remyelination in the corpus callosum (p < 0.02). The density of ermin-positive cells increased in the corpus callosum during the CPZ-phase of extensive remyelination (p < 0.0001). In MS, the density of ermin+ cells was higher in remyelinated lesion areas compared to non-remyelinated areas both in white- (p < 0.0001) and grey matter (p < 0.0001) and compared to normal-appearing white matter (p < 0.001).

Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) was used successfully to treat individuals with MDD. Here, we conducted a randomized clinical trial and pilot study, and tested the effectiveness of rTMS adjuvant to a standard pharmacological treatment among persons with MS, compared to a sham condition. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 persons with MS (mean age: 32 years; 42.5% females; median EDSS score: 4) and with moderate to severe symptoms of depression were randomly assigned to the rTMS or to the rTMS sham condition, always as adjuvant intervention to the standard treatment with sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). rTMS consisted of 10 sessions each of 37.5 min; the sham condition was identical to the active condition except for the absence of rTMS stimuli. At the beginning and two weeks after the end of the study, participants reported on their fatigue, while experts rated the severity of participants’ depressive symptoms (Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale; MADRS), cognitive performance (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; MoCA), and degree of disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale; EDSS). Results: Data were analyzed per intent-to-treat. Scores for depression, fatigue, and EDSS declined significantly over time (large effect sizes), but more so in the rTMS condition than in the sham condition (large effect sizes for the time by group-interactions). Compared to the sham condition, scores for depression were significantly lower in the rTMS condition. Scores for cognition improved over time in both study conditions (large effect size).

In autoimmune neurodegenerative diseases, a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) produced by CNS-infiltrating inflammatory cells binds to chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs). The latter are well-established obstacles to neural regeneration and remyelination in the CNS by interacting with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) and Nogo receptor (NgR) families. Here, we are showing that APRIL blocks the interactions of RPTP and NgR with all types of chondroitin sulphate (CS). Functionally, APRIL neutralized the inhibitory effects of CS on mouse and human neuronal process growth. APRIL also blocked the inhibition of CS on mouse and human oligodendrocyte differentiation. Finally, APRIL increased myelination in an ex vivo organotypic model of demyelination in the presence of endogenous CSPG upregulation. Our data demonstrate the potential value for a recombinant form of soluble APRIL to achieve repair in the CNS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Mashal Claude"},{"family":"Kakunuri","given":"Tejaswini"},{"family":"Peris","given":"Leticia"},{"family":"Meffre","given":"Delphine"},{"family":"Yilmaz","given":"Elif Nur"},{"family":"Grewing","given":"Laureen"},{"family":"Guerrero González","given":"Raquel"},{"family":"Manfroi","given":"Benoit"},{"family":"Gout","given":"Evelyne"},{"family":"Vivès","given":"Romain R"},{"family":"Fitzgerald","given":"Una"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Jafarian-Tehrani","given":"Mehrnaz"},{"family":"Kuhlmann","given":"Tanja"},{"family":"Huard","given":"Bertrand"}],"citation-key":"ahmedInflammatoryAPRILProliferationinducing2024","container-title":"Brain Communications","DOI":"10.1093/braincomms/fcae473","ISSN":"2632-1297","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,24]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"fcae473","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The inflammatory APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) antagonizes chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans to promote axonal growth and myelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcae473/8004815","volume":"7"},{"id":"ahujaLeveragingElectronicHealth2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Objective\n              No relapse risk prediction tool is currently available to guide treatment selection for multiple sclerosis (MS).

Due to their ability to repress pathogenic immune responses, and in particular T cell responses, they show therapeutic potential for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, organ rejection and graft versus host disease. MSCs have the remarkable ability to export their own mitochondria to neighboring cells in response to injury and inflammation. However, whether mitochondrial transfer occurs and has any role in the repression of CD4\n                +\n                Th1 responses is unknown.\n              \n            \n            \n              Methods and results\n              \n                In this report we have utilized CD4\n                +\n                T cells from HNT TCR transgenic mice that develop Th1-like responses upon antigenic stimulation in vitro and in vivo.

In co-culture experiments, we have shown that MSCs were able to reduce HNT CD4\n                +\n                T cell expansion, expression of key effector markers and production of the effector cytokine IFNγ after activation.

Remarkably, transfer of isolated MSC mitochondria to CD4\n                +\n                T cells resulted in decreased T cell proliferation and IFNγ production.

Inflammation‐triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress promote tissue damage in MS and in its preclinical animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Compound AA147 is a potent activator of the ATF6 signaling arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that can also induce antioxidant signaling through activation of the NRF2 pathway in neuronal cells. Previous work showed that AA147 protects multiple tissues against ischemia/reperfusion damage through ATF6 and/or NRF2 activation; however, its therapeutic potential in neuroinflammatory disorders remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that AA147 ameliorated the clinical symptoms of EAE and reduced ER stress, oligodendrocyte loss, and demyelination. Additionally, AA147 suppressed T cells in the CNS without altering the peripheral immune response. Importantly, AA147 significantly increased the expressions of\n              Grp78\n              , an ATF6 target gene, in oligodendrocytes, while enhancing levels of\n              Grp78\n              as well as\n              Ho‐1\n              , an NRF2 target gene, in microglia. In cultured oligodendrocytes, AA147 promoted nuclear translocation of ATF6, but not NRF2. Intriguingly, AA147 altered the microglia activation profile, possibly by triggering the NRF2 pathway. AA147 was not therapeutically beneficial during the acute EAE stage in mice lacking ATF6 in oligodendrocytes, indicating that protection primarily involves ATF6 activation in these cells. Overall, our results suggest AA147 as a potential therapeutic opportunity for MS by promoting oligodendrocyte survival and regulating microglia status through distinct mechanisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Aksu","given":"Metin"},{"family":"Kaschke","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Podojil","given":"Joseph R."},{"family":"Chiang","given":"MingYi"},{"family":"Steckler","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Bruce","given":"Kody"},{"family":"Cogswell","given":"Andrew C."},{"family":"Schulz","given":"Gwen"},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Jeffery W."},{"family":"Wiseman","given":"R.

Using C57BL/6 female mice, we dosed the PEPITEM in the EAE model via IP after observing the first sign of inflammation. The disease was induced using MOG35-55 and complete Freund’s adjuvants augmented with pertussis toxin. The EAE score was recorded daily until the end of the experiment (21 days). The histological and immunohistochemistry analysis was conducted on the spinal cord sections. A Western blot analysis was performed to measure the protein concentration of MBP, MAP-2, and N-Cadherin, and ELISA kits were used to measure IL-17 and FOXP3 in the serum and spinal cord lysate. The therapeutic treatment with PEPITEM reduced the CNS infiltration of T cells, and decreased levels of the protein concertations of MBP, MAP-2, and N-Cadherin were observed, in addition to reduced concertations of IL-17 and FOXP3.

However, the number of curated articles likely constitutes only a fraction of all the articles that contain experimentally determined DTIs. Finding such articles and extracting the experimental information is a challenging task, and there is a pressing need for systematic approaches to assist the curation of DTIs. To this end, we applied Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to identify such articles. Because DTI data intimately depends on the type of assays used to generate it, we also aimed to incorporate functions to predict the assay format.\nRESULTS: Our novel method identified 0.6 million articles (along with drug and protein information) which are not previously included in public DTI databases. Using 10-fold cross-validation, we obtained ~ 99% accuracy for identifying articles containing quantitative drug-target profiles. The F1 micro for the prediction of assay format is 88%, which leaves room for improvement in future studies.\nCONCLUSION: The BERT model in this study is robust and the proposed pipeline can be used to identify previously overlooked articles containing quantitative DTIs. Overall, our method provides a significant advancement in machine-assisted DTI extraction and curation. We expect it to be a useful addition to drug mechanism discovery and repurposing.","author":[{"family":"Aldahdooh","given":"Jehad"},{"family":"Vähä-Koskela","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Tanoli","given":"Ziaurrehman"}],"citation-key":"aldahdoohUsingBERTIdentify2022","container-title":"BMC bioinformatics","container-title-short":"BMC Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1186/s12859-022-04768-x","ISSN":"1471-2105","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"language":"eng","page":"245","PMCID":"PMC9214985","PMID":"35729494","source":"PubMed","title":"Using BERT to identify drug-target interactions from whole PubMed","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},{"id":"aldossariHistamineH4Receptor2023","abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative condition characterized by immune-mediated attacks on the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in demyelination and recurring T-cell responses. The histamine H4 receptor (H4R) is mainly expressed in cellular populations and plays a vital role in inflammation and immunological responses. The role of H4R in neurons of the CNS has recently been revealed. However, the precise role of H4R in neuronal function remains inadequately understood. The objective of this work was to investigate the impact of JNJ 10191584 (JNJ), a highly effective and specific H4R antagonist, on the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and to gain insight into the underlying mechanism involved. In this study, we examined the potential impact of JNJ therapy on the course of EAE in SJL/J mice. EAE mice were administered an oral dose of JNJ at a concentration of 6 mg/kg once a day, starting from day 10 and continuing until day 42. Afterward, the mice’s clinical scores were assessed. In this study, we conducted additional research to examine the impact of JNJ on several types of immune cells, specifically Th1 (IFN-γ and T-bet), Th9 (IL-9 and IRF4), Th17 (IL-17A and RORγt), and regulatory T (Tregs; Foxp3 and TGF-β1) cells in the spleen. In this study, we further investigated the impact of JNJ on the mRNA expression levels of IFN-γ, T-bet, IL-9, IRF4, IL-17A, RORγt, Foxp3, and TGF-β1 in the brain. Daily treatment of JNJ effectively reduced the development of EAE in mice. The percentages of CD4+IFN-γ+, CD4+T-bet+, CD4+IL-9+, CD4+IRF4+, CD4+IL-17A+, and CD4+RORγt+ cells were shown to decrease, whereas the percentages of CD4+TGF-β1+ and CD4+Foxp3+ cells were observed to increase in EAE mice treated with JNJ. Therefore, the HR4 antagonist positively affected the course of EAE by modulating the signaling of transcription factors. The identified results include possible ramifications in the context of MS treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Aldossari","given":"Abdullah A."},{"family":"Assiri","given":"Mohammed A."},{"family":"Ansari","given":"Mushtaq A."},{"family":"Nadeem","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Attia","given":"Sabry M."},{"family":"Bakheet","given":"Saleh A."},{"family":"Albekairi","given":"Thamer H."},{"family":"Alomar","given":"Hatun A."},{"family":"Al-Mazroua","given":"Haneen A."},{"family":"Almanaa","given":"Taghreed N."},{"family":"Al-Hamamah","given":"Mohammed A."},{"family":"Alwetaid","given":"Mohammad Y."},{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Sheikh F."}],"citation-key":"aldossariHistamineH4Receptor2023","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms242015273","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"15273","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Histamine H4 Receptor Antagonist Ameliorates the Progression of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis via Regulation of T-Cell Imbalance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/20/15273","volume":"24"},{"id":"alekseenkoClinnovaFederatedLearning2024","abstract":"Clinnova, a collaborative initiative involving France, Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg, is dedicated to unlocking the power of precision medicine through data federation, standardization, and interoperability.

However, the complex interplay between psychopathology and neurodiversity challenges identifying neuroanatomical features that anticipate long-term cognitive and symptomatic decline. Here, we collected MRI, cognitive, and symptomatic data from 165 healthy controls and 357 drug-naïve or minimally medicated FEP individuals that were followed up 1,3,5 and 10 years after the first episode. (1778 MRI scans and assessments in total). Using normative modelling, we derived subject-specific centile scores for cortical volume to investigate atypical deviations in FEP and their relationship to long-term cognitive and symptomatic deterioration. The resulting centile association maps were further characterized by examining their cytoarchitectural and neurobiological attributes using normative atlases.Aims To investigate cortical volume longitudinal deviations in FEP using normative modelling, exploring their relationship with long-term cognitive and symptomatic outcomes, as well as their cytoarchitectural and neurobiological underpinnings.Results FEP centiles showed a widespread reduction at treatment initiation, with longitudinal analysis showing an increase during treatment time, indicating convergence toward normal maturation trajectories. Interestingly, this effect was reduced in highly medicated individuals. Additionally, we found that cognitive impairments experienced during early FEP stages were correlated with centiles and mitigated by time. Positive symptomatology was negatively associated with regional centiles, and individuals with higher centiles benefited most from treatment. Cytoarchitectural and neurobiological analyses revealed that regional centiles related to FEP, as well as to cognitive function, were associated with specific molecular features, such as regional serotonin receptor densities in heteromodal areas.Conclusions Collectively, these findings underscore the potential use of centile-based normative modelling for a better understanding of how atypical cortical development contributes to the long-term clinical progression of neurodevelopmental conditions.Competing Interest StatementRAIB and JS hold equity in and are directors of Centile Bioscience.

Various types of non-pharmacological interventions are widely used, both in hospital and ambulatory/mobility settings to improve pain control in pwMS, but the effectiveness and safety of many non-pharmacological modalities is still unknown. OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological therapies for the management of chronic pain in pwMS. Specific questions to be addressed by this review include the following.Are non-pharmacological interventions (unidisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary rehabilitation) effective in reducing chronic pain in pwMS?What type of non-pharmacological interventions (unidisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary rehabilitation) are effective (least and most effective) and in what setting, in reducing chronic pain in pwMS? SEARCH METHODS: A literature search was performed using the specialised register of the Cochrane MS and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Review Group, using the Cochrane MS Group Trials Register which contains CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACUS, Clinical trials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 10 December 2017. Handsearching of relevant journals and screening of reference lists of relevant studies was carried out. SELECTION CRITERIA: All published randomised controlled trials (RCTs)and cross-over studies that compared non-pharmacological therapies with a control intervention for managing chronic pain in pwMS were included. Clinical controlled trials (CCTs) were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All three review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool for best-evidence synthesis. Pooling data for meta-analysis was not possible due to methodological, clinical and statistically heterogeneity of the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Overall, 10 RCTs with 565 participants which investigated different non-pharmacological interventions for the management of chronic pain in MS fulfilled the review inclusion criteria. The non-pharmacological interventions evaluated included: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), psychotherapy (telephone self-management, hypnosis and electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback), transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS), hydrotherapy (Ai Chi) and reflexology.There is very low-level evidence for the use of non-pharmacological interventions for chronic pain such as TENS, Ai Chi, tDCS, tRNS, telephone-delivered self-management program, EEG biofeedback and reflexology in pain intensity in pwMS. Although there were improved changes in pain scores and secondary outcomes (such as fatigue, psychological symptoms, spasm in some interventions), these were limited by methodological biases within the studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite the use of a wide range of non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of chronic pain in pwMS, the evidence for these interventions is still limited or insufficient, or both. More studies with robust methodology and greater numbers of participants are needed to justify the effect of these interventions for the management of chronic pain in pwMS.","author":[{"literal":"Amatya B"},{"literal":"Young J"},{"literal":"Khan F"}],"citation-key":"amatyabNonpharmacologicalInterventionsChronic2018","container-title":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD012622.pub2","ISSN":"1361-6137","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"Cd012622","title":"Non-pharmacological interventions for chronic pain in multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012622.pub2","volume":"12"},{"id":"amerioImmunomodulatoryEffectsClozapine2024","abstract":"Abstract:\n              Recent evidence suggests a possible relationship between the immune system and schizophrenia\nspectrum disorders (SSDs), as neuroinflammation appears to play a role in major psychiatric\nconditions. Neuroinflammation is as a broad concept representing a physiological protective response\nto infection or injury, but in some cases, especially if chronic, it may represent an expression of maladaptive\nprocesses, potentially driving to clinical dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Several studies\nare concurrently highlighting the importance of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central\nnervous system, in a huge number of neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s\nand Parkinson’s diseases, as well as SSDs. A more fundamental phenomenon of maladaptive\ncoupling of microglia may contribute to the genesis of dysfunctional brain inflammation involved in\nSSDs, from the onset of their neurophenomenological evolution. Clozapine and other antipsychotic\ndrugs seem to express a provable immunomodulant effect and a more specific action on microglia,\nwhile neuroactive steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce some SSDs symptoms\nin add-on therapy. Given these theoretical premises, this article aims to summarize and interpret\nthe available scientific evidence about psychotropic and anti-inflammatory drugs that could express an\nimmunomodulant activity on microglia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Amerio","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Magnani","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Arduino","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Fesce","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"De Filippis","given":"Renato"},{"family":"Parise","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Costanza","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Khoa D."},{"family":"Saverino","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"De Berardis","given":"Domenico"},{"family":"Aguglia","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Escelsior","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Serafini","given":"Gianluca"},{"family":"De Fazio","given":"Pasquale"},{"family":"Amore","given":"Mario"}],"citation-key":"amerioImmunomodulatoryEffectsClozapine2024","container-title":"Current Neuropharmacology","container-title-short":"CN","DOI":"10.2174/1570159X22666231128101725","ISSN":"1570159X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6]]},"language":"en","page":"1233-1247","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Immunomodulatory Effects of Clozapine: More Than Just a Side Effect inSchizophrenia","title-short":"Immunomodulatory Effects of Clozapine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.eurekaselect.com/223930/article","volume":"22"},{"id":"amiriCurcuminsSpiceinfusedTherapeutic2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Amiri","given":"Zahra"},{"family":"Jalili","given":"Shahla"},{"family":"Tarahomi","given":"Mahdieh"},{"family":"Eslami","given":"Majid"},{"family":"Yazdanpanah","given":"Esmaeil"},{"family":"Baharlou","given":"Rasoul"},{"family":"Esmaeili","given":"Seyed-Alireza"},{"family":"Yousefi","given":"Bahman"},{"family":"Haghmorad","given":"Dariush"}],"citation-key":"amiriCurcuminsSpiceinfusedTherapeutic2023","container-title":"Molecular Biology Reports","container-title-short":"Mol Biol Rep","DOI":"10.1007/s11033-023-08781-y","ISSN":"0301-4851, 1573-4978","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"language":"en","page":"8843-8853","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Curcumin’s spice-infused therapeutic promise: disease severity alleviation in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis via modulation of immune responses","title-short":"Curcumin’s spice-infused therapeutic promise","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11033-023-08781-y","volume":"50"},{"id":"amiriProtectiveEffectsHesperidin2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Amiri","given":"Hamed"},{"family":"Javid","given":"Hossein"},{"family":"Hashemi","given":"Seyedeh Fatemeh"},{"family":"Reihani","given":"Amirali"},{"family":"Esparham","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Hashemy","given":"Seyed Isaac"}],"citation-key":"amiriProtectiveEffectsHesperidin2024","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2023.105401","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2]]},"language":"en","page":"105401","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The protective effects of hesperidin as an antioxidant against quinolinic acid-induced toxicity on oligodendroglia cells: An in vitro study","title-short":"The protective effects of hesperidin as an antioxidant against quinolinic acid-induced toxicity on oligodendroglia cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034823009008","volume":"82"},{"id":"ammarNeuroprotectiveEffectLiraglutide2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              The heterogeneous nature of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the unavailability of treatments addressing its intricate network and reversing the disease state is yet an area that needs to be elucidated.

Demyelination was induced in C57Bl/6 mice by cuprizone (400 mg/kg/day p.o.) for 5 weeks. Animals received either liraglutide (25 nmol/kg/day i.p.) or dorsomorphin, an AMPK inhibitor, (2.5 mg/Kg i.p.) 30 min before the liraglutide dose, for 4 weeks (starting from the second week). Liraglutide improved the behavioral profile in cuprizone-treated mice. Furthermore, it induced the re-myelination process through stimulating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells differentiation via Olig2 transcription activation, reflected by increased myelin basic protein and myelinated nerve fiber percentage. Liraglutide elevated the protein content of p-AMPK and SIRT1, in addition to the autophagy proteins Beclin-1 and LC3B. Liraglutide halted cellular damage as manifested by reduced HMGB1 protein and consequently TLR-4 downregulation, coupled with a decrease in NF-κB. Liraglutide also suppressed NLRP3 transcription. Dorsomorphin pre-administration indicated a possible interplay between AMPK/SIRT1 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation as it partially reversed liraglutide’s effects. Immunohistochemical examination of Iba\n              +\n              microglia emphasized these findings. In conclusion, liraglutide exerts neuroprotection against cuprizone-induced demyelination via anti-inflammatory, autophagic flux activation, NLRP3 inflammasome suppression, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms, possibly mediated, at least in part, via AMPK/SIRT1, autophagy, TLR-4/ NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling.\n            \n            \n              Graphical abstract\n            \n            The potential mechanistic insight of Lira in alleviating Cup-induced neurotoxicity via: (1) AMPK/SIRT1 pathways activation resulting in the stimulation of brain autophagy flux (confirmed by lowering Beclin-1 and LC3-B protein expression). (2) Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as evidenced by reduced HMGB1, TLR-4, NF-κB and NLRP3 protein expression, alongside diminishing the activation of its downstream cascade as reflected by reduced levels of caspase-1 and IL-1β protein expression. (3) A possible modulating interplay between the previously mentioned two pathways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ammar","given":"Reham A."},{"family":"Mohamed","given":"Ahmed F."},{"family":"Kamal","given":"Mohamed M."},{"family":"Safar","given":"Marwa M."},{"family":"Abdelkader","given":"Noha F."}],"citation-key":"ammarNeuroprotectiveEffectLiraglutide2022","container-title":"Inflammopharmacology","container-title-short":"Inflammopharmacol","DOI":"10.1007/s10787-022-00956-6","ISSN":"0925-4692, 1568-5608","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6]]},"language":"en","page":"919-934","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neuroprotective effect of liraglutide in an experimental mouse model of multiple sclerosis: role of AMPK/SIRT1 signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome","title-short":"Neuroprotective effect of liraglutide in an experimental mouse model of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10787-022-00956-6","volume":"30"},{"id":"amosSocialTabooTorch2000a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Amos","given":"A."},{"family":"Haglund","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"amosSocialTabooTorch2000a","container-title":"Tobacco Control","DOI":"10.1136/tc.9.1.3","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",3]]},"language":"en","page":"3","PMID":"10691743","source":"pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","title":"From social taboo to \"torch of freedom\": the marketing of cigarettes to women","title-short":"From social taboo to \"torch of freedom\"","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1748294/","volume":"9"},{"id":"anacomDiaInternacionalLiteracia2023","abstract":"Estes dados resultam do indicador global de literacia digital da Comissão Europeia, referentes a 2021 e incluem estatísticas sobre a população e as empresas..

Paradoxically, in autoimmune conditions, including of the CNS, IL-12 reduces inflammation. The underlying mechanism behind these opposing properties and the involved cellular players remain elusive. Here we map IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) expression to NK and T cells as well as neurons and oligodendrocytes. Conditionally ablating the IL-12R across these cell types in adult mice and assessing their susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis revealed that the neuroprotective role of IL-12 is mediated by neuroectoderm-derived cells, specifically neurons, and not immune cells. In human brain tissue from donors with multiple sclerosis, we observe an IL-12R distribution comparable to mice, suggesting similar mechanisms in mice and humans. Combining flow cytometry, bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we reveal an IL-12-induced neuroprotective tissue adaption preventing early neurodegeneration and sustaining trophic factor release during neuroinflammation, thereby maintaining CNS integrity in mice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Andreadou","given":"Myrto"},{"family":"Ingelfinger","given":"Florian"},{"family":"De Feo","given":"Donatella"},{"family":"Cramer","given":"Teresa L.

Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyolotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) are some of the most frequent neurodegenerative diseases. Despite their diversity, these diseases share some common pathophysiological mechanisms: the abnormal aggregation of disease-related misfolded proteins, autophagosome–lysosome pathway dysregulation, impaired ubiquitin–proteasome system, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive neuroinflammation. There is still no effective drug that could halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and the current treatments are mainly symptomatic. In this regard, the development of novel multi-target pharmaceutical approaches presents an attractive therapeutic strategy. Ibudilast, an anti-inflammatory drug firstly developed as an asthma treatment, is a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) inhibitor, which mainly acts by increasing the amount of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), while downregulating the pro-inflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4). The preclinical evidence shows that ibudilast may act neuroprotectively in neurodegenerative diseases, by suppressing neuroinflammation, inhibiting apoptosis, regulating the mitochondrial function and by affecting the ubiquitin–proteasome and autophagosome–lysosome pathways, as well as by attenuating oxidative stress. The clinical trials in ALS and progressive MS also show some promising results. Herein, we aim to provide an update on the emerging preclinical and clinical evidence on the therapeutic potential of ibudilast in these disorders, discuss the potential challenges and suggest the future directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Angelopoulou","given":"Efthalia"},{"family":"Pyrgelis","given":"Efstratios-Stylianos"},{"family":"Piperi","given":"Christina"}],"citation-key":"angelopoulouEmergingPotentialPhosphodiesterase2022","container-title":"Molecules","container-title-short":"Molecules","DOI":"10.3390/molecules27238448","ISSN":"1420-3049","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,2]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"8448","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Emerging Potential of the Phosphodiesterase (PDE) Inhibitor Ibudilast for Neurodegenerative Diseases: An Update on Preclinical and Clinical Evidence","title-short":"Emerging Potential of the Phosphodiesterase (PDE) Inhibitor Ibudilast for Neurodegenerative Diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/23/8448","volume":"27"},{"id":"ansariCCR1AntagonistJ1138632022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ansari","given":"Mushtaq A."},{"family":"Nadeem","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Attia","given":"Sabry M."},{"family":"Bakheet","given":"Saleh A."},{"family":"Shahid","given":"Mudassar"},{"family":"Rehman","given":"Muneeb U."},{"family":"Alanazi","given":"Mohammed M."},{"family":"Alhamed","given":"Abdullah S."},{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Khalid E"},{"family":"Albekairi","given":"Norah A"},{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Sheikh F."}],"citation-key":"ansariCCR1AntagonistJ1138632022","container-title":"Immunobiology","container-title-short":"Immunobiology","DOI":"10.1016/j.imbio.2022.152245","ISSN":"01712985","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"en","page":"152245","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"CCR1 antagonist J-113863 corrects the imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in a SJL/J mouse model of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0171298522000717","volume":"227"},{"id":"antelSeekingNeuroprotectionMultiple2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Antel","given":"Jack P."},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"Timothy E."},{"family":"Kuhlmann","given":"Tanja"}],"citation-key":"antelSeekingNeuroprotectionMultiple2023","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","DOI":"10.1172/JCI168595","ISSN":"1558-8238","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,3]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"e168595","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Seeking neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis: an ongoing challenge","title-short":"Seeking neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jci.org/articles/view/168595","volume":"133"},{"id":"antonijevicDesignSynthesisBiological2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Antonijevic","given":"Mirjana"},{"family":"Charou","given":"Despoina"},{"family":"Ramos","given":"Isbaal"},{"family":"Valcarcel","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Gravanis","given":"Achille"},{"family":"Villace","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Callizot","given":"Noelle"},{"family":"Since","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Dallemagne","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Charalampopoulos","given":"Ioannis"},{"family":"Rochais","given":"Christophe"}],"citation-key":"antonijevicDesignSynthesisBiological2023","container-title":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","container-title-short":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejmech.2023.115111","ISSN":"02235234","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"en","page":"115111","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Design, synthesis and biological characterization of novel activators of the TrkB neurotrophin receptor","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0223523423000260","volume":"248"},{"id":"appelGenerativeAIHas2023","abstract":"Generative AI, which uses data lakes and question snippets to recover patterns and relationships, is becoming more prevalent in creative industries.

To protect themselves from these risks, companies that use generative AI need to ensure that they are in compliance with the law and take steps to mitigate potential risks, such as ensuring they use training data free from unlicensed content and developing ways to show provenance of generated content.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Appel","given":"Gil"},{"family":"Neelbauer","given":"Juliana"},{"family":"Schweidel","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"appelGenerativeAIHas2023","container-title":"Harvard Business Review","ISSN":"0017-8012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,7]]},"section":"Intellectual property","source":"hbr.org","title":"Generative AI Has an Intellectual Property Problem","type":"article-magazine","URL":"https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem"},{"id":"arabfirozjaeLuteinImprovesRemyelination2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Arab Firozjae","given":"Atefeh"},{"family":"Shiran","given":"Mohammad Reza"},{"family":"Ajami","given":"Abolghasem"},{"family":"Farzin","given":"Davood"},{"family":"Rashidi","given":"Mohsen"}],"citation-key":"arabfirozjaeLuteinImprovesRemyelination2024","container-title":"Heliyon","container-title-short":"Heliyon","DOI":"10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e39253","ISSN":"24058440","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10]]},"language":"en","page":"e39253","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Lutein improves remyelination by reducing of neuroinflammation in C57BL/6 mouse models of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S240584402415284X","volume":"10"},{"id":"arabmoazzenRETRACTEDEvaluationEffects2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Arabmoazzen","given":"Saiedeh"},{"family":"Mirshekar","given":"Mohammad Ali"}],"citation-key":"arabmoazzenRETRACTEDEvaluationEffects2021","container-title":"Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy","container-title-short":"Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111932","ISSN":"07533322","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"en","page":"111932","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"RETRACTED: Evaluation of the effects of metformin as adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activator on spatial learning and memory in a rat model of multiple sclerosis disease","title-short":"RETRACTED","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0753332221007149","volume":"141"},{"id":"araghiTransplantationHumanUmbilical2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Araghi","given":"Mohamad Mahdi Esmaeili"},{"family":"Abdolmaleki","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Ghaleh","given":"Hadi Esmaeili Gouvarchin"},{"family":"Kondori","given":"Bahman Jalali"},{"family":"Alvanegh","given":"Akbar Ghorbani"},{"family":"Moghaddam","given":"Mehrdad Moosazadeh"},{"family":"Hosseini Nejad Anbaran","given":"Seyed Javad"}],"citation-key":"araghiTransplantationHumanUmbilical2024","container-title":"Anatomy & Cell Biology","container-title-short":"Anat Cell Biol","DOI":"10.5115/acb.24.082","ISSN":"2093-3665, 2093-3673","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,30]]},"language":"en","page":"333-345","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells optimized with IFN-γ is a potential procedure for modification of motor impairment in multiple sclerosis cases: a preclinical systematic review and meta-analysis study","title-short":"Transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells optimized with IFN-γ is a potential procedure for modification of motor impairment in multiple sclerosis cases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://acbjournal.org/journal/view.html?doi=10.5115/acb.24.082","volume":"57"},{"id":"arbelaezSTAT1SignalingProtects2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Arbelaez","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Palle","given":"Pushpalatha"},{"family":"Charaix","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Bettelli","given":"Estelle"}],"citation-key":"arbelaezSTAT1SignalingProtects2022","container-title":"JCI Insight","DOI":"10.1172/jci.insight.148222","ISSN":"2379-3708","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,22]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"e148222","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"STAT1 signaling protects self-reactive T cells from control by innate cells during neuroinflammation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/148222","volume":"7"},{"id":"arellanoTherapeuticRoleInterferong2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Cumulative evidence has established that Interferon (IFN)-γ has both pathogenic and protective roles in Multiple Sclerosis and the animal model, Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the underlying mechanisms to the beneficial effects of IFN-γ are not well understood. In this study, we found that IFN-γ exerts therapeutic effects on chronic, relapsing-remitting, and chronic progressive EAE models. The frequency of regulatory T (Treg) cells in spinal cords from chronic EAE mice treated with IFN-γ was significantly increased with no effect on Th1 and Th17 cells. Consistently, depletion of FOXP3-expressing cells blocked the protective effects of IFN-γ, indicating that the therapeutic effect of IFN-γ depends on the presence of Treg cells. However, IFN-γ did not trigger direct in vitro differentiation of Treg cells. In vivo administration of blocking antibodies against either interleukin (IL)-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β or program death (PD)-1, revealed that the protective effects of IFN-γ in EAE were also dependent on TGF-β and PD-1, but not on IL-10, suggesting that IFN-γ might have an indirect role on Treg cells acting through antigen-presenting cells. Indeed, IFN-γ treatment increased the frequency of a subset of splenic CD11b\n              +\n              myeloid cells expressing TGF-β-Latency Associated Peptide (LAP) and program death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in a signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1-dependent manner.

Remarkably, adoptive transfer of splenic CD11b\n              +\n              cells from IFN-γ-treated EAE mice into untreated recipient mice ameliorated clinical symptoms of EAE and limited central nervous system infiltration of mononuclear cells and effector helper T cells. These results reveal a novel cellular and molecular mechanism whereby IFN-γ promotes beneficial effects in EAE by endowing splenic CD11b\n              +\n              myeloid cells with tolerogenic and therapeutic activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Arellano","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Acuña","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Loda","given":"Eileah"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Lindsay"},{"family":"Tichauer","given":"Juan E."},{"family":"Castillo","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Vergara","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Burgos","given":"Paula I."},{"family":"Penaloza-MacMaster","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Stephen D."},{"family":"Naves","given":"Rodrigo"}],"citation-key":"arellanoTherapeuticRoleInterferong2024","container-title":"Journal of Neuroinflammation","container-title-short":"J Neuroinflammation","DOI":"10.1186/s12974-024-03126-3","ISSN":"1742-2094","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"language":"en","page":"144","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Therapeutic role of interferon-γ in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is mediated through a tolerogenic subset of splenic CD11b+ myeloid cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-024-03126-3","volume":"21"},{"id":"ariNeuroregenerationImprovedSodiumDLBetaHydroxybutyrate2024","abstract":"Ketone bodies are considered alternative fuels for the brain when glucose availability is limited. To determine the neuroregenerative potential of D,L-sodium-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D/L-BHB), Sprague Dawley rat primary cortical neurons were exposed to simulated central nervous system injury using a scratch assay. The neuronal cell migration, cell density and degree of regeneration in the damaged areas (gaps) in the absence (control) and presence of BHB (2 mM) were documented with automated live-cell imaging by the CytoSMART system over 24 h, which was followed by immunocytochemistry, labeling synapsin-I and β3-tubulin. The cell density was significantly higher in the gaps with BHB treatment after 24 h compared to the control. In the control, only 1.5% of the measured gap areas became narrower over 24 h, while in the BHB-treated samples 49.23% of the measured gap areas became narrower over 24 h. In the control, the gap expanded by 63.81% post-injury, while the gap size decreased by 10.83% in response to BHB treatment, compared to the baseline. The cell density increased by 97.27% and the gap size was reduced by 74.64% in response to BHB, compared to the control. The distance travelled and velocity of migrating cells were significantly higher with BHB treatment, while more synapsin-I and β3-tubulin were found in the BHB-treated samples after 24 h, compared to the control. The results demonstrate that D/L-BHB enhanced neuronal migration and molecular processes associated with neural regeneration and axonogenesis.

Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.\nAI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.\nThe field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\". This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity. Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals. The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI's true technological capabilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,27]]},"citation-key":"ArtificialIntelligence2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,25]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1151741030","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Artificial intelligence","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Artificial_intelligence&oldid=1151741030#History"},{"id":"ArtificialIntelligenceAI","citation-key":"ArtificialIntelligenceAI","container-title":"Chartered Institute of Public Relations","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and the impact on public relations (PR) practice","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"asmisDietarySupplementation23Hydroxy2024","abstract":"23-Hydroxy ursolic acid (23-OH UA) is a potent atheroprotective and anti-obesogenic phytochemical, with anti-inflammatory and inflammation-resolving properties.

However, when things go wrong, we are also responsible for taking an ethical stand and trying to solve problems, and this work aims to take a step in this direction. Our goal is to set the foundation for a mathematically formal study of how we might regulate social media and, in particular, address the problem of the echo chamber effect. An echo chamber is a closed system where other voices are excluded by omission, causing your beliefs to become amplified or reinforced. In turn, these bubbles can boost social polarization and extreme political views, and, unfortunately, there is strong evidence that echo chambers exist in social media. The fundamental question we try to answer is: how and can a regulation “break” or reduce the echo chamber effect in social media? Sadly, the paper’s main result is an impossibility result: a general regulation function that achieves this goal (on our social media model) while obeying the core values of democratic societies (freedom of expression and user privacy) does not exist. This result leaves us with hard future choices to make.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Avin","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Daltrophe","given":"Hadassa"},{"family":"Lotker","given":"Zvi"}],"citation-key":"avinImpossibilityBreakingEcho2024","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-023-50850-6","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,11]]},"language":"en","license":"2024 The Author(s)","page":"1107","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"On the impossibility of breaking the echo chamber effect in social media using regulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50850-6","volume":"14"},{"id":"Awe50meAwesomeAI2024","abstract":"A curated list of awesome things related to artificial intelligence tools","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,26]]},"citation-key":"Awe50meAwesomeAI2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,26]]},"original-date":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,30]]},"publisher":"awe50me","source":"GitHub","title":"awe50me/Awesome-AI","type":"software","URL":"https://github.com/awe50me/Awesome-AI"},{"id":"ayanwuyiBriefElectricalNerve2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ayanwuyi","given":"Lydia"},{"family":"Tokarska","given":"Nataliya"},{"family":"McLean","given":"NikkiA"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"JayneM"},{"family":"Verge","given":"ValerieM.

Curcumin (CUR) and piperine (PP) show a protective effect on neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. This research was designed to measure several biochemical parameters in the brain tissue of CP‐applied rats to investigate the impact of combined CUR–PP administration. The study evaluated six groups of eight rats: Group 1 was the control; Groups 2 and 3 were administered 200 or 300 mg/kg CUR‐PP via oral gavage; Group 4 received only 200 mg/kg CP on day 1; Groups 5 and 6 received CP + CUR‐PP for 7 days. Data from all parameters indicated that CP caused brain damage. Phosphorylated TAU (pTAU), amyloid‐beta peptide 1–42 (Aβ1–42), glutamate (GLU), and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) parameters were the same in Groups 4, 5, and 6. On the other hand, 8‐hydroxy‐2‐deoxyguanosine (8‐OHdG), nitric oxide (NO), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF‐kβ), malondialdehyde (MDA), and tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) levels in the CP + CUR‐PP groups were lower than those in the CP group (\n              p\n               < 0.05). However, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and reduced glutathione (GSH) parameters were higher in the CP + CUR‐PP groups compared to the CP group (\n              p\n               < 0.05). It is thought that the similarity of Groups 5 and 6 with Group 4 in Aβ1–42, pTAU, GLU, and GABA parameters hinder the determination of treatment protection however, they might have a therapeutic effect if the applied dose or study duration were changed. This study attempted to evaluate the effects of a CUR–PP combination on CP‐induced brain damage in rats by measuring biochemical parameters and performing histopathological examinations. Based on the findings, this CUR–PP combination could be considered an alternative medicine option in cases with conditions similar to those evaluated in this study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Aygörmez","given":"Serpil"},{"family":"Maraşli","given":"Şaban"}],"citation-key":"aygormezInvestigationEffectsCurcumin2024","container-title":"Journal of Biochemical and Molecular Toxicology","container-title-short":"J Biochem &amp; Molecular Tox","DOI":"10.1002/jbt.23760","ISSN":"1095-6670, 1099-0461","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7]]},"language":"en","page":"e23760","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Investigation of the effects of curcumin and piperine on cyclophosphamide‐induced brain injury in rats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbt.23760","volume":"38"},{"id":"azarniaInterIntraraterReliability2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Azarnia","given":"Somayeh"},{"family":"Abdollahi","given":"Iraj"},{"family":"Minoo","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Naghdi","given":"Soofia"},{"family":"Salavati","given":"Mahyar"}],"citation-key":"azarniaInterIntraraterReliability2021","container-title":"Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies","container-title-short":"Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbmt.2020.09.004","ISSN":"13608592","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"language":"en","page":"515-518","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The inter- and intra-rater reliability of Modified Tardieu Scale in assessing spasticity of knee extensors in patients with multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1360859220301765","volume":"26"},{"id":"azharBriumviBreakthroughTreatment2023","abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by plaques of demyelination, autoimmune inflammation, and astrocytic gliosis. The primary cells involved in the pathophysiology of MS are T cells. However, B cells have recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease. Therefore, researchers have been exploring B cell therapy as an alternative treatment option for MS. B cell therapy is based on the targeted depletion of CD20-positive B cells. Rituximab, ocrelizumab, and ofatumumab are anti-CD20 antibodies already approved. Briumvi, the fourth type of anti-CD20 antibody was approved by FDA in December 2022, for the treatment of relapsing types of MS, including relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, and clinically isolated syndromes after the drug was tested in two randomized, double-blind, phase III, ULTIMATE I, and II trials which compared Briumvi (ublituximab) with Aubiago (teriflunomide). Ublituximab was found to have a much lower annual relapse rate in the ULTIMATE II trials than teriflunomide. Briumvi is a chimeric recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against human CD20 with potential antineoplastic activity. Its mechanism of action involves several distinct processes that collectively lead to the depletion of B cells and suppression of the immune response. The primary mode of action of Briumvi is its high-affinity binding to CD20. Infusion-related reactions are the most common side effects encountered following intravenous administration of ublituximab.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Azhar","given":"Ayesha"},{"family":"Taimuri","given":"Muskan Asim"},{"family":"Shamat","given":"Shamat Fathi"},{"family":"Ikram","given":"Areeba"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Sajjad"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Tehreem"},{"family":"Khabir","given":"Yumna"}],"citation-key":"azharBriumviBreakthroughTreatment2023","container-title":"Annals of Medicine & Surgery","DOI":"10.1097/MS9.0000000000001184","ISSN":"2049-0801","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"4909-4912","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Briumvi: a breakthrough in the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis: a review","title-short":"Briumvi","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/MS9.0000000000001184","volume":"85"},{"id":"azimiaEffectsVitaminSupplements2019","abstract":"Background:Vitamin D is one of the considerable environmental factors exhibiting immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effect of vitamin D supplements on IL-10 and INFγ levels in patients with multiple sclerosis. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Ovid, The Cochrane Library and gray literature, including references of selected studies, conference abstracts which were published up to May 2019. We included single- or double-blinded RCTs or open-label trials in which one of the main outcomes was INFγ and/ or IL-10 levels after vitamin D supplementation. Only articles that had been published in English were included. Results: The literature search yielded 369 articles, that were monitored by us. After eliminating duplicates, 128 studies remained; from these, we excluded observational studies, reviews, case reports and non-randomized trials, and 33 studies remained. Finally, only three articles were included. The mean difference for INFγ was 268.4 and 95 % CI 200.6-336.1. There was no significant heterogeneity (I ² = 0 %, Chi ² = 0.1, p = 0.7). The mean difference for IL-10 was 398.3 and 95% CI -528.05-1324.8). There was significant heterogeneity (I2 = 94 %, Chi2 = 31.1 p < 0.001).

This study aims to project the future number of people with multiple sclerosis in Germany until 2040 which is necessary for effective resource allocation and health care planning.\nMETHODS: Based on data from the German statutory health insurance, the age- and sex-specific prevalence of multiple sclerosis was estimated applying mathematical relations between prevalence, incidence rate, and mortality rate. Subsequently, the projected prevalence was applied to the age structure of the German population between 2015 and 2040 to calculate the future number of people with multiple sclerosis. Several temporal trend scenarios pertaining to the incidence and mortality rate were compared.\nRESULTS: Application of current age-specific prevalence estimates combined with the projected population structure in 2040, results in a decline of 8% in the number of people with multiple sclerosis. More realistic scenarios that reflect on trends in mortality and incidence rates, project between 453,000 (+75%) and 477,000 (+85%) multiple sclerosis cases in 2040. It is expected that females will be affected nearly 2.5 times more frequently than males in 2040.\nCONCLUSION: The findings indicate a substantial rise in the prevalence of multiple sclerosis, ranging from 75% to 85% in 2040 compared to 2015. Assuming a constant age-specific prevalence between 2015 and 2040 without any temporal trends in mortality and incidence rates may underestimate the actual number of cases and consequently, future requirements for healthcare resources.","author":[{"family":"Baginski","given":"Kira"},{"family":"Voeltz","given":"Dina"},{"family":"Hoyer","given":"Annika"}],"citation-key":"baginskiProjectedNumberPeople2024","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Mult Scler Relat Disord","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2024.105774","ISSN":"2211-0356","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"105774","PMID":"39032398","source":"PubMed","title":"Projected number of people with multiple sclerosis in Germany between 2015 and 2040","type":"article-journal","volume":"89"},{"id":"bagozziMarketingExchange1975","abstract":"The exchange concept is a key factor in understanding the expanding role of marketing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Bagozzi","given":"Richard P."}],"citation-key":"bagozziMarketingExchange1975","container-title":"Journal of Marketing","DOI":"10.1177/002224297503900405","ISSN":"0022-2429","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1975",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"32-39","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Marketing as Exchange","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/002224297503900405","volume":"39"},{"id":"bairdPhysicalActivityCardiorespiratory2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Baird","given":"Jessica F."},{"family":"Cutter","given":"Gary R."},{"family":"Motl","given":"Robert W."}],"citation-key":"bairdPhysicalActivityCardiorespiratory2022","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2022.103702","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4]]},"language":"en","page":"103702","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Do physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and subcortical brain structures explain reduced walking performance in older adults with multiple sclerosis?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034822002176","volume":"60"},{"id":"bajramiOcrelizumabReducesCortical2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Introduction\n              Ocrelizumab (OCR) and Fingolimod (FGL) are two high-efficacy treatments in multiple sclerosis which, besides their strong anti-inflammatory activity, may limit neurodegeneration.\n            \n            \n              Aim\n              To compare the effect of OCR and FGL on clinical and MRI endpoints.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              95 relapsing–remitting patients (57 OCR, 38 FGL) clinically followed for 36 months underwent a 3-Tesla MRI at baseline and after 24 months.

Methods: Mid-trimester pregnant rats treated with valproate on embryonic day 12.5 and their offspring were selected as autism model. The autism rats were randomly assigned to autism group and AVP treatment group that given AVP by inhalation per day from postnatal days 21 to 42. The changes in social behavior and the hippocampus transcriptome were compared, and the hub genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Mendelian randomization (MR). Results: 403 genes were found to be differentially expressed in the autism model, with the majority of these genes being involved in oligodendrocyte development and myelination. Only 11 genes associated with myelination exhibited statistically significant alterations following AVP treatment when compared to the autism group. Gene set enrichment, expression patterns, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analysis consistently indicated that the biological processes of oligodendrocyte development and myelination were markedly enriched in the autism group and exhibited improvement following treatment. The variation trend of various nerve cells demonstrated a notable increase in the proportion of oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the autism group, which subsequently exhibited a significant decline following treatment. Five hub genes (MBP, PLIP, CNP, GFAP, and TAOK1) were verified by qPCR. Finally, MR studies have confirmed a causal relationship between hippocampal myelination-related gene expression and the risk of autism. Conclusions: AVP could markedly enhance social interaction abilities in the autism rat model, possibly due to the significantly improved hippocampus oligodendrocytes development and myelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bao","given":"Xingxing"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Min"}],"citation-key":"baoEffectsArginineVasopressin2024","container-title":"Frontiers in Bioscience-Landmark","container-title-short":"Front.

The prevalence of MS is much more common in women than men. The women are exposed to a variety of symptoms including fatigue. Acupressure is a noninvasive procedure that can be used to control symptoms including fatigue. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of acupressure on fatigue in women with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted on 100 women with MS at Tehran MS Association. The subjects were equally allocated to experimental group and a placebo group (50 women per group) by blocking randomization method. The experimental group were received acupressure, at the true points (ST36, SP6, LI4) and the placebo group, were received touching at the same points. Fatigue was measured by a Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) in the groups at immediately prior to, two and four weeks after the beginning of the intervention. The data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics by SPSS version 17. RESULTS: The findings indicated no differences in demographic characteristics and the severity of fatigue at the baseline in two groups (p=0.54). But there were significant reductions of the mean score of fatigue in the experimental group compared to the placebo group immediately, two and four weeks after the intervention respectively (p=0.03, p?0/001, p=0.04).

The imaging method includes a multi-shell scheme, free water correction to obtain tissue-specific measurements, probabilistic tracking algorithm robust to crossing fibers and white matter lesions, automatic streamlines and bundle dissection and tract-profiling with tractometry.

The fornix and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus exhibited a higher free water fraction. Eight bundles showed an increase in total apparent fiber density and four bundles had a higher number of fiber orientations, suggesting axonal swelling and increased organization complexity, respectively.

THC interferes with synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis and impacts the brain’s macrostructure, specifically white matter where CB1 receptors are abundant. The current study aims to investigate whether callosal morphology differs depending on how much experience individuals have with marijuana.Methods This is a quantitative between-group corpus callosum morphology analysis using cohort study data. The data for this study (n = 144) came from the S1200 Release from the Washington University – University of Minnesota Human Connectome Project Consortium (WU–Minn HCP). Marijuana use was quantified using self-reports and grouped as (1) no use, (2) low use, and (3) high use. T1-weighted MRI brain images were obtained and then processed using SPM12 and MATLAB. Each corpus callosum was manually traced and automatically separated into seven callosal areas according to the Witelson parcellation scheme. The resulting area measures were compared between the three groups, while covarying for total brain volume.Results Our ANCOVA analysis was significant (F(2, 145) = 4.38, p = .014), and posthoc tests revealed a significantly smaller anterior midbody in the high marijuana use group compared to the no marijuana use group (p = .012).Conclusion Smaller callosal areas in the high use marijuana group suggest that heavy cannabis may be related to weaker interhemispheric connectivity. Future research is required to replicate the current findings using well-powered designs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo funding was obtained for this article.

METHOD: The literature search examined five databases (Medline, Embase, AMED, Cochrane (CENTRAL), and CINAHL until the end of November 2016. Eligible studies included medication to address symptoms associated with MS and an objective gait outcome measure. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality using structured data extraction forms and the PEDro scale. RESULTS: From 249 papers identified, 13 papers met inclusion criteria, examining three medications. Fampridine was found to significantly increase gait speed, but only in those people who responded to medication, which was less than half (pooled mean: 39%). Ten milligrams of fampridine twice daily significantly improves gait endurance. No definitive conclusions can be made about the efficacy of cannabinoid medication due to conflicting results across three studies. A single study of baclofen did not provide evidence to support the use of this medication to improve gait. CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence is available to guide gait symptom control for people with MS. Further research that includes three-dimensional gait analysis, patient perceived measures of gait dysfunction and explores combined efficacy of other modalities on gait is needed. Implications for Rehabilitation Gait disturbance is a common and disabling symptom of multiple sclerosis. Fampridine and cannabis medication may increase gait speed, baclofen does not. Fampridine can be used to improve gait endurance. Future research should include both quantitative and qualitative outcome measures of gait and investigate the combined efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to assist clinicians to maximise gait improvements.","author":[{"literal":"Behm K"},{"literal":"Morgan P"}],"citation-key":"behmkEffectSymptomcontrollingMedication2018","container-title":"Disability and rehabilitation","DOI":"10.1080/09638288.2017.1309581","ISSN":"1464-5165","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1-12","title":"The effect of symptom-controlling medication on gait outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis: a systematic review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2017.1309581","volume":"40"},{"id":"behrangiSiponimodAmelioratesMetabolic2022","abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune-driven, inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), causes irreversible accumulation of neurological deficits to a variable extent. Although there are potent disease-modifying agents for its initial relapsing–remitting phase, immunosuppressive therapies show limited efficacy in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Although modulation of sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors has proven beneficial during SPMS, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this project, we followed the hypothesis that siponimod, a sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor modulator, exerts protective effects by direct modulation of glia cell function (i.e., either astrocytes, microglia, or oligodendrocytes). To this end, we used the toxin-mediated, nonautoimmune MS animal model of cuprizone (Cup) intoxication. On the histological level, siponimod ameliorated cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte degeneration, demyelination, and axonal injury. Protective effects were evident as well using GE180 translocator protein 18-kDa (TSPO) imaging with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging or next generation sequencing (NGS). Siponimod also ameliorated the cuprizone-induced pathologies in\n              Rag1\n              -deficient mice, demonstrating that the protection is independent of T and B cell modulation. Proinflammatory responses in primary mixed astrocytes/microglia cell cultures were not modulated by siponimod, suggesting that other cell types than microglia and astrocytes are targeted. Of note, siponimod completely lost its protective effects in\n              S1pr5\n              -deficient mice, suggesting direct protection of degenerating oligodendrocytes. Our study demonstrates that siponimod exerts protective effects in the brain in a S1PR5-dependent manner. This finding is not just relevant in the context of MS but in other neuropathologies as well, characterized by a degeneration of the axon–myelin unit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Behrangi","given":"Newshan"},{"family":"Heinig","given":"Leo"},{"family":"Frintrop","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Santrau","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Kurth","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Krause","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Atanasova","given":"Dimitrinka"},{"family":"Clarner","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Fragoulis","given":"Athanassios"},{"family":"Joksch","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Rudolf","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Meuth","given":"Sven G."},{"family":"Joost","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Kipp","given":"Markus"}],"citation-key":"behrangiSiponimodAmelioratesMetabolic2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

However, their roles in autoimmune diseases are still unclear, which hampers the development of efficient immunotherapies. The role of different MDSCs subsets in multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosus displayed different mechanisms of immune suppression, and several studies pointed to MDSCs’ capacity to induce T‐helper (Th)17 cells and tissue damage. These results also suggested that MDSCs could be present in different functional states and utilize different mechanisms for controlling the activity of T and B cells. Therefore, various therapeutic strategies should be employed to restore homeostasis in autoimmune diseases. The therapies harnessing MDSCs could be designed either as cell therapy or rely on the expansion and activation of MDSCs in vivo, or their depletion. Cumulatively, MDSCs are inevitable players in autoimmunity, and rational approaches in developing therapies are required to avoid the adverse effects of MDSCs and harness their suppressive mechanisms to improve the overall efficacy of autoimmunity therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bekić","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Tomić","given":"Sergej"}],"citation-key":"bekicMyeloidderivedSuppressorCells2023","container-title":"European Journal of Immunology","container-title-short":"Eur J Immunol","DOI":"10.1002/eji.202250345","ISSN":"0014-2980, 1521-4141","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"language":"en","page":"2250345","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells in the therapy of autoimmune diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eji.202250345","volume":"53"},{"id":"belkinaImplementingGenerativeAI2025","abstract":"The introduction of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, like ChatGPT, into higher education heralds a transformative era, reshaping instructional methods, enhancing student support systems, and redefining the educational landscape.

Prior studies demonstrated that the mechanistic target of the rapamycin pathway promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and developmental myelination; however, how the immediate downstream targets of mechanistic target of rapamycin regulate these processes has not been elucidated. Here, we tested the hypothesis that p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation during developmental myelination and remyelination processes in the CNS. We demonstrate that p70 ribosomal S6 kinase activity peaks in oligodendrocyte lineage cells at the time when they transition to myelinating oligodendrocytes during developmental myelination in the mouse spinal cord. We further show p70 ribosomal S6 kinase activity in differentiating oligodendrocytes in acute demyelinating lesions induced by lysophosphatidylcholine injection or by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. In demyelinated lesions, the expression of the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase target, phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein, was transient and highest in maturing oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, we also identified p70 ribosomal S6 kinase activity in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in active multiple sclerosis lesions. Consistent with its predicted function in promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation, we demonstrate that specifically inhibiting p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 in cultured oligodendrocyte precursor cells significantly impairs cell lineage progression and expression of myelin basic protein. Finally, we used zebrafish to show in vivo that inhibiting p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 function in oligodendroglial cells reduces their differentiation and the number of myelin internodes produced. These data reveal an essential function of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 in promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation during development and remyelination across multiple species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Benardais","given":"Karelle"},{"family":"Ornelas","given":"Isis M."},{"family":"Fauveau","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Tanya L."},{"family":"Finseth","given":"Lisbet T."},{"family":"Panic","given":"Radmila"},{"family":"Deboux","given":"Cyrille"},{"family":"Macklin","given":"Wendy B."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Teresa L."},{"family":"Nait-Oumesmar","given":"Brahim"}],"citation-key":"benardaisP70S6KinaseRegulates2022","container-title":"Brain Communications","DOI":"10.1093/braincomms/fcac025","ISSN":"2632-1297","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,4]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"fcac025","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"p70S6 kinase regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and is active in remyelinating lesions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcac025/6527564","volume":"4"},{"id":"benhaimEvidenceGlutamineSynthetase2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Glutamine synthetase (GS) is a key enzyme that metabolizes glutamate into glutamine.

There is a need to find effective therapies, especially to reverse the progressive demyelination and neuronal damage. Oligodendrocytes form the myelin sheath around axons in the central nervous system (CNS) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) undergo mechanisms that enable spontaneously the partial repair of damaged lesions. The aim of this study was to discover small molecules with potential effects in demyelinating diseases, including (re)myelinating properties.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Recently, it has been shown how LRRK2 inhibition promotes oligodendrogliogenesis and therefore an efficient repair or myelin damaged lesions.

The loss of evoked rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the monosynaptic H-reflex is indicative of hyperreflexia, a physiological sign of spasticity. Given the intimate relationship between astrocytes and neurons, that is, the tripartite synapse, we hypothesized that astrocytes might have a significant role in post-injury hyperreflexia and plasticity of neighboring neuronal synaptic dendritic spines. Here, we investigated the effect of selective Rac1KO in astrocytes (i.e., adult male and female mice, transgenic cre-flox system) on SCI-induced spasticity. Three weeks after a mild contusion SCI, control Rac1\n              wt\n              animals displayed a loss of H-reflex RDD, that is, hyperreflexia. In contrast, transgenic animals with astrocytic Rac1KO demonstrated near-normal H-reflex RDD similar to pre-injury levels. Reduced hyperreflexia in astrocytic Rac1KO animals was accompanied by a loss of thin-shaped dendritic spine density on a-motor neurons in the ventral horn. In SCI-Rac1\n              wt\n              animals, as expected, we observed the development of dendritic spine dysgenesis on a-motor neurons associated with spasticity. As compared with WT animals, SCI animals with astrocytic Rac1KO expressed increased levels of the glial-specific glutamate transporter, glutamate transporter-1 in the ventral spinal cord, potentially enhancing glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft and reducing hyperreflexia in astrocytic Rac1KO animals. Taken together, our findings show for the first time that Rac1 activity in astrocytes can contribute to hyperreflexia underlying spasticity following SCI. These results reveal an opportunity to target cell-specific molecular regulators of H-reflex excitability to manage spasticity after SCI.\n            \n            \n              Significance Statement\n              Spinal cord injury leads to stretch reflex hyperexcitability, which underlies the clinical symptom of spasticity. This study shows for the first time that astrocytic Rac1 contributes to the development of hyperreflexia after SCI. Specifically, astrocytic Rac1KO reduced SCI-related H-reflex hyperexcitability, decreased dendritic spine dysgenesis on a-motor neurons, and elevated the expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1). Overall, this study supports a distinct role for astrocytic Rac1 signaling within the spinal reflex circuit and the development of SCI-related spasticity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Benson","given":"Curtis A."},{"family":"Olson","given":"Kai-Lan"},{"family":"Patwa","given":"Siraj"},{"family":"Kauer","given":"Sierra D."},{"family":"King","given":"Jared F."},{"family":"Waxman","given":"Stephen G."},{"family":"Tan","given":"Andrew M."}],"citation-key":"bensonConditionalAstrocyteRac1KO2024","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

METHODS: A literature search was performed in November 2018 (CRD42018103615). Eligibility criteria: randomised control trials in English from 2012 to 2018; a clinical diagnosis of MS; interventions containing vitamin D supplementation (vitamin D3 or calcitriol) in disease activity compared to a control/placebo; improvement in: serum 25(OH)D, relapse rates, disability status by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, cytokine profile, quality of life, mobility, T2 lesion load and new T2 or T1 Gd enhancing lesions, safety and adverse effects. Risk of bias was evaluated. RESULTS: Ten studies were selected. The study size ranged from 40 to 94 people. All studies evaluated the use of vitamin D supplementation (ranging from 10 to 98,000 IU), comparing to a placebo or low dose vitamin D. The duration of the intervention ranged from 12 to 96 weeks. One trial found a significant effect on EDSS score, three demonstrated a significant change in serum cytokines level, one found benefits to current enhancing lesions and three studies evaluating the safety and tolerability of vitamin D reported no serious adverse events. Disease measures improved to a greater extent overall in those with lower baseline serum 25(OH)D levels.

Infection by viruses and bacteria has been found to be strongly associated with the onset of MS or its severity. We postulated that the immune system’s attack on the myelin sheath could be triggered by viruses and bacteria antigens that resemble myelin sheath components. An in-silico bioinformatics approach was undertaken in order to identify viral and bacterial antigens that resemble myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and myelin basic protein (MBP). To this end, we simultaneously analyzed both protein structures and amino acid sequences from viral and bacterial proteins and compared them to MOG and MBP. Possible associations between MBP and human parvovirus B19 (HPV-B19) and adeno-associated virus 4 (AAV-4) capsid protein structures were identified. MBP and MOG were associated with antigens from different viruses and bacteria, including\n              Aspergillus species\n              ,\n              Lactobacillus\n              ,\n              Burkholderia\n              ,\n              Clostridium\n              ,\n              Schizosaccharomyces\n              , SARS-CoV-2, and some gut flora metabolites.

Identical amino acids between MBP and BSH at the active site, and protected amino acids in MOG aligning with WcfQ and Wzy enzymes were observed.

It is well-documented that the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2) is induced by inflammatory stimuli and regulates adaptive and innate immune responses, cell death, and the production of inflammatory mediators. However, the impact of cIAP2 on neuroinflammation associated with MS and disease severity remains unknown.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely used mouse model of MS, to assess the effect of cIAP2 deletion on disease outcomes. We performed a detailed analysis on the histological, cellular, and molecular levels. We generated and examined bone-marrow chimeras to identify the cIAP2-deficient cells that are critical to the disease outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                cIAP2\n                −/−\n                mice exhibited increased EAE severity, increased CD4\n                +\n                T cell infiltration, enhanced proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression, and augmented demyelination. This phenotype was driven by cIAP2-deficient non-hematopoietic cells. cIAP2 protected oligodendrocytes from cell death during EAE by limiting proliferation and activation of brain microglia. This protective role was likely exerted by cIAP2-mediated inhibition of the non-canonical NLRP3/caspase-8-dependent myeloid cell activation during EAE.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our findings suggest that cIAP2 is needed to modulate neuroinflammation, cell death, and survival during EAE.

Rather than competing within the confines of the existing industry or trying to steal customers from rivals, Cirque developed uncontested market space that made the competition irrelevant. Cirque created what the authors call a blue ocean, a previously unknown market space. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In red oceans—that is, in all the industries already existing—companies compete by grabbing for a greater share of limited demand. As the market space gets more crowded, prospects for profits and growth decline. Products turn into commodities, and increasing competition turns the water bloody. There are two ways to create blue oceans. One is to launch completely new industries, as eBay did with online auctions. But it’s much more common for a blue ocean to be created from within a red ocean when a company expands the boundaries of an existing industry. In studying more than 150 blue ocean creations in over 30 industries, the authors observed that the traditional units of strategic analysis—company and industry—are of limited use in explaining how and why blue oceans are created. The most appropriate unit of analysis is the strategic move, the set of managerial actions and decisions involved in making a major market-creating business offering. Creating blue oceans builds brands. So powerful is blue ocean strategy, in fact, that a blue ocean strategic move can create brand equity that lasts for decades.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"W.

This association, however, may differ by apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. This work examines interactions between age, PA, and neuropathology-based genetic risk for AD (APOEnp) on Aβ burden in cortical regions sensitive to its accumulation.Materials and Methods Included were 388 cognitively unimpaired, older (mean age ± SD = 68.10 ± 7.09; 66% female) participants from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP) study. The cohort was enriched with both family history of AD at enrollment and a higher overall prevalence of APOE ε4 allele carriage than typically observed in the general population. PA was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire. Aβ burden was measured using Pittsburg Compound B (11C-PiB) PET imaging, which allowed us to derive volume corrected distribution volume ratio (DVR) maps from nine bilateral regions of interest (ROIs) and a global cortical composite score. Linear regression models examined the interactions between age, PA, and APOEnp on Aβ burden. Finally, APOEnp scores were aggregated according to estimated risk to illustrate the differential effects between active (weekly moderate PA &gt; 150 minutes) and inactive individuals.Results Three-way interactions (Age × PA × APOEnp) were significant (all P’s ≤ 0.05) for the global cortical composite and six of the examined ROIs (the PPC, ACC, mOFC, SMG, MTG, and STG). Models stratified by APOEnp and PA showed greater levels of age-related Aβ accumulation in each of these ROIs, with the greatest effects in inactive participants with high APOEnp scores.Conclusion Individuals with high APOEnp scores who concomitantly engage in suboptimal weekly moderate-intensity PA have greater Aβ burden. These findings underscore how both PA and APOEnp haplotype play intersect in modifying age-related Aβ burden in brain regions susceptible to its deposition in cognitively unimpaired, older adults at risk for AD.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by National Institute on Aging grants R01 AG062167 (O.C.O.), R01 AG077507 (O.C.O.), R01 AG085592 (O.C.O.), R01 AG027161 (S.C.J.), R01 AG021155 (S.C.J.), R01 AG054059 (C.E.G.) and P30 AG062715 (S.A.); and a Clinical and Translational Science Award (UL1RR025011) to the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

evidence suggests that adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MeD) can reduce inflammation in chronic diseases; however, studies pertaining to relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) are limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential of the modiﬁed MeD (mMeD) in improving Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores, disability and fatigue severity, compared with traditional Iranian diet (TID), in RRMS patients. RESULTS: Of the 180 patients enrolled, 147 participants were included in the ﬁnal analysis (n of mMeD = 68; n of TID = 79). Self-reported adherence was good (˜81 %). Dietary intakes of forty-five food parameters were assessed through the FFQ. The mMeD significantly reduced DII scores after 6 months (2·38 ± 0·21 to -1·87 ± 0·86, P < 0·001), but TID did not elicit any changes (2·21 ± 0·44 to 2·14 ± 1·01, P = 0·771). Additionally, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) total score decreased significantly (72·4 ± 17·2 to 63·9 ± 14·2, P < 0·001), whereas there was no considerable improvement for Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in the mMeD group. METHODS: After initial screening (n 261), 180 RRMS patients were randomised to receive mMeD or TID (as control) for 6 months. DII score, EDSS and twenty-one-item MFIS were evaluated at baseline and trial cessation.

The gut microbiome, also undergoing extensive developmental changes in early life, may influence brain development through metabolism of neuroactive compounds. Here, we leverage longitudinal data from 194 infants across the first 18 months of life to show that microbial genes encoding enzymes that metabolize molecules playing a key role in modulating early neuroplasticity are associated with visual cortical neurodevelopment, measured by the Visual-Evoked Potential (VEP). Neuroactive compounds included neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate, the amino acid tryptophan, and short-chain fatty acids involved in myelination, including acetate and butyrate. Microbial gene sets around 4 months of age were strongly associated with the VEP from around 9 to 14 months of age and showed more associations than concurrently measured gene sets, suggesting microbial metabolism in early life may affect subsequent neural plasticity and development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Wellcome LEAP 1kDAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Health Research Ethics Committees (University of Cape Town study number: 666/2021)I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In this review article, different experimental approaches based mainly on the application of different cell types as therapeutic strategies applied for the induction of myelin repair and/or the amelioration of the disease are discussed. Regarding this issue, different cell sources were applied in various experimental models of MS, with different results, both in significant improvements in remyelination and the reduction of neuroinflammation and glial activation, or in neuroprotection. All cell types tested have advantages and disadvantages, which makes it difficult to choose a better option for therapeutic application in MS.

Evidence relates neuropathic pain to demyelination, which often originates from unresolved neuroinflammation or altered immune response. Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression might play a fundamental role in the regulation of these processes. The ELAV RNA-binding proteins HuR and HuD are involved in the promotion of inflammatory phenomena and in neuronal development and maintenance, respectively. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of HuR and HuD in demyelination-associated neuropathic pain in the mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. HuR resulted  overexpressed in the spinal cord of MOG\n              35-55\n              –EAE and PLP\n              139-151\n              –EAE mice and was detected in CD11b + cells. Conversely, HuD was largely downregulated in the MOG–EAE spinal cord, along with GAP43 and neurofilament H, while in PLP-EAE mice, HuD and neuronal markers remained unaltered. Intranasal antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) delivery to knockdown HuR, increased myelin basic protein expression, and Luxol Fast Blue staining in both EAE models, an indication of increased myelin content. These effects temporally coincided with attenuation of pain hypersensitivity. Anti-HuR ASO increased the expression of HuD in GAP43-expressing cells and promoted a HuD-mediated neuroprotective activity in MOG–EAE mice, while in PLP–EAE mice, HuR silencing dampened pro-inflammatory responses mediated by spinal microglia activation. In conclusion, anti-HuR ASO showed myelin protection at analgesic doses with multitarget mechanisms, and it deserves further consideration as an innovative agent to counteract demyelination in neuropathic pain states.\n            \n            \n              Graphical Abstract","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Borgonetti","given":"Vittoria"},{"family":"Galeotti","given":"Nicoletta"}],"citation-key":"borgonettiPosttranscriptionalRegulationGene2023","container-title":"Molecular Neurobiology","container-title-short":"Mol Neurobiol","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-023-03236-8","ISSN":"0893-7648, 1559-1182","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"en","page":"2661-2677","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Posttranscriptional Regulation of Gene Expression Participates in the Myelin Restoration in Mouse Models of Multiple Sclerosis: Antisense Modulation of HuR and HuD ELAV RNA Binding Protein","title-short":"Posttranscriptional Regulation of Gene Expression Participates in the Myelin Restoration in Mouse Models of Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12035-023-03236-8","volume":"60"},{"id":"borimEffectRapamycinMOGReactive2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Borim","given":"Patricia Aparecida"},{"family":"Mimura","given":"Luiza Ayumi Nishiyama"},{"family":"Zorzella-Pezavento","given":"Sofia Fernanda Gonçalves"},{"family":"Polonio","given":"Carolina Manganeli"},{"family":"Peron","given":"Jean Pierre Schatzmann"},{"family":"Sartori","given":"Alexandrina"},{"family":"Fraga-Silva","given":"Thais Fernanda De Campos"}],"citation-key":"borimEffectRapamycinMOGReactive2022","container-title":"Journal of Interferon & Cytokine Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Interferon & Cytokine Research","DOI":"10.1089/jir.2021.0206","ISSN":"1079-9907, 1557-7465","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.liebertpub.com/nv/resources-tools/text-and-data-mining-policy/121/","page":"153-160","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect of Rapamycin on MOG-Reactive Immune Cells and Lipopolysaccharide-Activated Microglia: An <i>In Vitro</i> Approach for Screening New Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis","title-short":"Effect of Rapamycin on MOG-Reactive Immune Cells and Lipopolysaccharide-Activated Microglia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jir.2021.0206","volume":"42"},{"id":"borremansMasteringCrisisCommunication2023","abstract":"\"Mastering Crisis Communication with ChatGPT: A Practical Guide\" covers key strategies for utilizing the AI's technical writing and summarizing skills to generate fictive crisis scenarios, reactive statements, key messages, and plans for crisis communication.","author":[{"family":"Borremans","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"borremansMasteringCrisisCommunication2023","edition":"PublishDrive edition","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,8]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"67","publisher":"PublishDrive","source":"Amazon","title":"Mastering Crisis Communication with ChatGPT: A Practical Guide","title-short":"Mastering Crisis Communication with ChatGPT","type":"book"},{"id":"boschhomeptConsciousnessArtificialIntelligence2015","abstract":"John Searle is the Slusser Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley.

In a subset of participants with complete baseline data across measures of global cognition, executive function, and language (n=163), we examined the association of ADI with longitudinal change.RESULTS Higher neighborhood deprivation was associated with shorter survival after symptom onset and faster decline in global cognition, executive and language functions, independent of genetic risk.DISCUSSION Living in more deprived neighborhoods (i.e. above the 50th percentile nationally) was associated with an accelerated disease course in bvFTD, highlighting an important socioeconomic disparity in disease prognosis.Clinical Trial Registration Information N/ACompeting Interest StatementL.D. has received consulting fees from Passage Bio, Biogen, and Sano Genetics.Funding StatementResearch reported in this publication was supported by the Penn Institute on Aging, and the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health under award numbers P01AG066597, P30AG072979, P30AG012836 (Penn Population Aging Research Center), P30AG073105 (PennAITech) and R01AG076832.

On the contrary, excessive IRE1 activity is often detrimental and may contribute to neurodegeneration. To determine the consequences of increased activation of IRE1α, we used a mouse model expressing a C148S variant of IRE1α with increased and sustained activation. Surprisingly, the mutation did not affect the differentiation of highly secretory antibody‐producing cells but exhibited a beneficial effect in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although mechanical allodynia was unaffected, significant improvement in motor function was found in IRE1C148S mice with EAE relative to wild type (WT) mice. Coincident with this improvement, there was reduced microgliosis in the spinal cord of IRE1C148S mice, with reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes. This was accompanied by reduced axonal degeneration and enhanced 2',3'‐cyclic nucleotide 3'‐phosphodiesterase (CNPase) levels, suggesting improved myelin integrity. Interestingly, while the IRE1C148S mutation is expressed in all cells, the reduction in proinflammatory cytokines and in the microglial activation marker ionized calcium‐binding adapter molecule (IBA1), along with preservation of phagocytic gene expression, all point to microglia as the cell type contributing to the clinical improvement in IRE1C148S animals. Our data suggest that sustained increase in IRE1α activity can be beneficial in vivo, and that this protection is cell type and context dependent. Considering the overwhelming but conflicting evidence for the role of ER stress in neurological diseases, a better understanding of the function of ER stress sensors in physiological contexts is clearly needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bracchi‐Ricard","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Kayla"},{"family":"Ricci","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Gaudette","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Henao‐Mejia","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Brambilla","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Martynyuk","given":"Tetyana"},{"family":"Gidalevitz","given":"Tali"},{"family":"Allman","given":"David"},{"family":"Bethea","given":"John R."},{"family":"Argon","given":"Yair"}],"citation-key":"bracchi-ricardIncreasedActivityIRE12023","container-title":"The FASEB Journal","container-title-short":"The FASEB Journal","DOI":"10.1096/fj.202300769RR","ISSN":"0892-6638, 1530-6860","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"language":"en","page":"e23283","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Increased activity of <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">IRE1</span> improves the clinical presentation of <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">EAE</span>","title-short":"Increased activity of <span style=\"font-variant","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fj.202300769RR","volume":"37"},{"id":"braunBenefitsAHSCTAlemtuzumab2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Braun","given":"Bente"},{"family":"Fischbach","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Richter","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Pfeffer","given":"Lena Kristina"},{"family":"Fay","given":"Heike"},{"family":"Reinhardt","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Friese","given":"Manuel A"},{"family":"Stellmann","given":"Jan-P."},{"family":"Kröger","given":"Nicolaus M."},{"family":"Heesen","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Häußler","given":"Vivien"}],"citation-key":"braunBenefitsAHSCTAlemtuzumab2024","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2023.105414","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2]]},"language":"en","page":"105414","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Benefits of aHSCT over alemtuzumab in patients with multiple sclerosis besides disability and relapses: Sustained improvement in cognition and quality of life","title-short":"Benefits of aHSCT over alemtuzumab in patients with multiple sclerosis besides disability and relapses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034823009136","volume":"82"},{"id":"braunGenericOutcomeAssessment2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Mobility capacity is a key outcome domain in neurorehabilitation.

Patients with mood disorders, such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD), also show elevated cardiovascular risk and inflammatory markers, suggesting shared biological pathways between mood and cardiometabolic conditions. The kynurenine (KYN) pathway, activated by inflammatory cytokines and involved in neurotransmitter systems linked to mood, provides a promising area to explore inflammatory-related genetic overlaps in these disorders, with increasing interest in the SH2B3 rs3184504 SNP. Imaging markers like white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and white matter (WM) microstructure alterations are associated with mood and cardiovascular disorders.This study aimed to investigate the genetic load link to KYN levels, such as KYN polygenic risk score (PRS) and its effect on white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), outcomes of presumed vascular suffering, and WM microstructure in a sample of 95 MDD and 80 BD patients.Higher PRS for KYN was associated with increased circulating KYN levels and KYN/TRP ratio. KYN PRS predicted the presence of WMHs. The SH2B3 rs3184504 T variant was associated with increased PRS for KYN and a higher number of WMHs. KYN levels and KYN/TRP ratio were not associated with WMHs, while KYN PRS positively correlated with higher axial (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD), with a nominal significance for radial diffusivity (RD).The findings support a genetic contribution to elevated KYN and WM integrity alterations in mood disorders. PRS for KYN indicates a potential predisposition to inflammatory and vascular dysregulation, and SH2B3 rs3184504 may modulate this risk.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding for this study was provided by the Italian Ministry of Health, Grant PNRR-MAD-2022-12375859Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The local ethical committee approved all the research activities (IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele) and complied with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Increased microglial reactivity following TBI may underlie chronic neuroinflammation, neuropathology, and exaggerated responses to immune challenges. Therefore, the goal of this study was to force turnover of trauma-associated microglia that develop after diffuse TBI and determine whether this alleviated chronic inflammation, improved functional recovery and attenuated reduced immune reactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Male mice received a midline fluid percussion injury (mFPI) and 7 d later were subjected to a forced microglia turnover paradigm using CSF1R antagonism (PLX5622). At 30 d postinjury (dpi), cortical gene expression, dendritic complexity, myelin content, neuronal connectivity, cognition, and immune reactivity were assessed. Myriad neuropathology-related genes were increased 30 dpi in the cortex, and 90% of these gene changes were reversed by microglial turnover. Reduced neuronal connectivity was evident 30 dpi and these deficits were attenuated by microglial turnover. TBI-associated dendritic remodeling and myelin alterations, however, remained 30 dpi independent of microglial turnover. In assessments of functional recovery, increased depressive-like behavior, and cognitive impairment 30 dpi were ameliorated by microglia turnover. To investigate microglial priming and reactivity 30 dpi, mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS. This immune challenge caused prolonged lethargy, sickness behavior, and microglial reactivity in the TBI mice. These extended complications with LPS in TBI mice were prevented by microglia turnover. Collectively, microglial turnover 7 dpi alleviated behavioral and cognitive impairments associated with microglial priming and immune reactivity 30 dpi.\n            \n              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT\n              A striking feature of traumatic brain injury (TBI), even mild injuries, is that over 70% of individuals have long-term neuropsychiatric complications. Chronic inflammatory processes are implicated in the pathology of these complications and these issues can be exaggerated by immune challenge. Therefore, our goal was to force the turnover of microglia 7 d after TBI. This subacute 7 d postinjury (dpi) time point is a critical transitional period in the shift toward chronic inflammatory processes and microglia priming. This forced microglia turnover intervention in mice attenuated the deficits in behavior and cognition 30 dpi. Moreover, microglia priming and immune reactivity after TBI were also reduced with microglia turnover. Therefore, microglia represent therapeutic targets after TBI to reduce persistent neuroinflammation and improve recovery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bray","given":"Chelsea E."},{"family":"Witcher","given":"Kristina G."},{"family":"Adekunle-Adegbite","given":"Dunni"},{"family":"Ouvina","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Witzel","given":"Mollie"},{"family":"Hans","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Tapp","given":"Zoe M."},{"family":"Packer","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Ethan"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Fangli"},{"family":"Chunchai","given":"Titikorn"},{"family":"O'Neil","given":"Shane"},{"family":"Chattipakorn","given":"Siriporn C."},{"family":"Sheridan","given":"John"},{"family":"Kokiko-Cochran","given":"Olga N."},{"family":"Askwith","given":"Candice"},{"family":"Godbout","given":"Jonathan P."}],"citation-key":"brayChronicCorticalInflammation2022","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

We conducted a transcriptomic investigation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and caudate from 86 controls, 57 ED, and 27 OCD cases. ED was associated with robust differentially expressed genes (DEGs): 102 DEGs the DLPFC and 222 in the caudate (FDR &lt; 1%) and replicated in an independent cohort. For OCD, no DEGs reached significance; however, meta-analysis with extant data identified 57 DEGs in the caudate. High concordance in transcriptomic changes was observed between ED and OCD in both regions (DLPFC r=0.67, caudate r=0.75). A combined ED+OCD analysis uncovered 233 DEGs in the DLPFC and 816 in the caudate, implicating disrupted GABAergic neuron function, neuroendocrine pathways, metabolism, and synaptic processes. Genetically regulated expression analysis identified nine genes with strong evidence for increasing ED risk, further validating these pathways. These findings reveal a shared molecular basis for ED and OCD, offering new insights into their pathobiology and potential therapeutic targets.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by R01 MH124679 (DEG) and the Beatrice and Samuel A.

Such ‘back‐and‐forth’ immune responses are rare. I speculate how such back‐and‐forth immune responses may arise. Understanding the nature of these different modes, and what controls their mutual transition, may help in designing strategies to favour the nonpathogenic mode, thus constituting treatment. Antigen dose is known to be critical in determining the class/subclass of primary immune responses. Observations have led us to suggest the level of antigen also similarly influences the class/subclass of on‐going immune responses. I propose the relapsing, inflammatory and the remitting modes are respectively sustained by relatively low and high amounts of the responsible autoantigens, as is the case, for example, for Th1 and Th2 responses to foreign antigens. In addition, I propose more self‐antigens are released during an inflammatory than during a remitting mode. The decrease in the amount of antigen released, as the response transitions from an inflammatory to a remitting mode, results in time in a decreased level of antigen and so the response again evolves towards the inflammatory mode. The inflammatory mode then leads to an increased release of antigen and so, in time, to remission. This model thus explains the transition between different modes. I outline non‐invasive, testable predictions of the hypothesis. If confirmed, it may be ethical to examine whether the non‐inflammatory mode can be sustained by administering myelin antigens during the remitting phase.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bretscher","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"bretscherRelapsingRemittingMultiple2023","container-title":"Scandinavian Journal of Immunology","container-title-short":"Scand J Immunol","DOI":"10.1111/sji.13325","ISSN":"0300-9475, 1365-3083","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"language":"en","page":"e13325","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis: A speculative model and its implications for a novel treatment","title-short":"Relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sji.13325","volume":"98"},{"id":"bridgemanDissectingRegulatoryCell2023","abstract":"Biomaterials allow for the precision control over the combination and release of cargo needed to engineer cell outcomes. These capabilities are particularly attractive as new candidate therapies to treat autoimmune diseases, conditions where dysfunctional immune cells create pathogenic tissue environments during attack of self-molecules termed self-antigens. Here we extend past studies showing combinations of a small molecule immunomodulator co-delivered with self-antigen induces antigen-specific regulatory T cells. In particular, we sought to elucidate how different ratios of these components loaded in degradable polymer particles shape the antigen presenting cell (APC) -T cell interactions that drive differentiation of T cells toward either inflammatory or regulatory phenotypes. Using rapamycin (rapa) as a modulatory cue and myelin self-peptide (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein- MOG) – self-antigen attacked during multiple sclerosis (MS), we integrate these components into polymer particles over a range of ratios and concentrations without altering the physicochemical properties of the particles. Using primary cell co-cultures, we show that while all ratios of rapa:MOG significantly decreased expression of co-stimulation molecules on dendritic cells (DCs), these levels were insensitive to the specific ratio. During co-culture with primary T cell receptor transgenic T cells, we demonstrate that the ratio of rapa:MOG controls the expansion and differentiation of these cells. In particular, at shorter time points, higher ratios induce regulatory T cells most efficiently, while at longer time points the processes are not sensitive to the specific ratio.

However, the clinical course of MS varies significantly both within and between individuals, and the optimal treatment strategy remains uncertain at the group and individual levels. Addressing questions about treatment strategies through traditional randomized controlled trials is unrealistic due to the large sample sizes and high costs required. Instead, large-scale multicenter registries and well-characterized prospective observational cohorts offer a feasible approach to generating meaningful insights. For valid results, such registries and cohorts require harmonization across centers to support comprehensive, standardized, user-friendly data collection while meeting data protection standards and ensuring quality control.Objective This project aims to establish standardized, nationwide MS data collection in Austria.Methods The project consists of five key components: i) harmonization of data collection, ii) creation of infrastructure for data sharing, iii) retrospective harmonized data collection (Austrian MS Database, AMSD), iv) prospective harmonized data collection (Austrian MS Cohort, AMSC), and v) aggregated analyses.Results A comprehensive set of harmonized common data elements (CDE) comprising clinical and paraclinical data was developed and a common data collection infrastructure was generated using the web-based Research, Documentation, and Analysis platform (webRDA), an innovative data capture, processing, and analysis system provided by the Medical University of Vienna offering pseudonymized storage of data supported by a robust permissions system sufficing legal data protection and ethical requirements.The AMSC is set up as a standardized prospective collection of demographic, clinical, epidemiological, psycho-socio-economic, MRI, and OCT data as well as body fluids.Conclusion The AMSD and AMSC will facilitate the evidence-based development of prognostic biomarkers, individualized therapy strategies and treatment sequences based on a high-quality, population-based dataset of more than 8,000 people with MS.Competing Interest StatementGabriel Bsteh: has participated in meetings sponsored by, received speaker honoraria or travel funding from Biogen, Celgene/BMS, Janssen, Lilly, Merck, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi-Genzyme and Teva, and received honoraria for consulting Biogen, Celgene/BMS, Janssen, Merck, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi-Genzyme and Teva.

In the current review, we discuss recent findings on oxidative-stress-related inflammation mediated by the gut–brain axis in multiple sclerosis (MS). Growing evidence suggests targeting gut microbiota can be a promising strategy for MS management. Intricate interaction between multiple factors leads to increased intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity, frequently painting a different picture in vivo from that obtained under controlled conditions. Following an evidence-based approach, all proposed interventions should be validated in clinical trials with cohorts large enough to reach significance. Our review summarizes existing clinical trials focused on identifying suitable interventions, the suitable combinations, and appropriate timings to target microbiota-related oxidative stress. Most studies assessed relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS); only a few studies with very limited cohorts were carried out in other MS stages (e.g., secondary progressive MS–SPMS). Future trials must consider an extended time frame, perhaps starting with the perinatal period and lasting until the young adult period, aiming to capture as many complex intersystem interactions as possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Buga","given":"Ana Maria"},{"family":"Padureanu","given":"Vlad"},{"family":"Riza","given":"Anca-Lelia"},{"family":"Oancea","given":"Carmen Nicoleta"},{"family":"Albu","given":"Carmen Valeria"},{"family":"Nica","given":"Alexandru Dan"}],"citation-key":"bugaGutBrainAxis2023","container-title":"Cells","container-title-short":"Cells","DOI":"10.3390/cells12141872","ISSN":"2073-4409","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,17]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1872","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Gut–Brain Axis as a Therapeutic Target in Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/12/14/1872","volume":"12"},{"id":"bulleyDevelopmentClinicalGuidelines2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Over the past 20 years Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) has grown in clinical use to support walking in people with lower limb weakness or paralysis due to upper motor neuron lesions.

We’ve worked in various tricky and complex contexts where we were confronted with a raft of responses ranging from: ‘quick fixes’, ‘offthe-shelf solutions’, ‘transplanted solutions’, to ‘we’re stuck’. We’ve seen the effects of analysis paralysis, diving down wombat holes (the Australian alternative to rabbit holes!), and getting lost in problems that were not really the problem. So, we started to explore ways in which we could work with people to ‘zoom out’ and focus on how they could frame and name problems more effectively, recognise different types of problems, and start to ‘learn’ their way into responding. We developed some of our own ways of helping people, and we borrowed some of the great tools and frameworks others have used to support better framings and responses to problems. We drew these together in a canvas to help people spend more time framing problems rather than jumping headlong into problem ‘solving’. We found that this approach helped people to develop better skills to analyse problems and to reflect, test, and learn about possible responses more effectively. The response from teams we’ve worked with has been very positive – and we’ve refined the canvas via feedback and testing. In 2022 we shared the canvas in one of our social media posts and were inundated with requests for deeper explanations of each of the segments. In response, in 2023 we are making our Problem Framing Canvas workshop materials open source through this workbook.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Burkett","given":"Ingrid"}],"citation-key":"burkettProblemFramingCanvas2023","genre":"Report","ISBN":"9781922361639","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"English","note":"Accepted: 2023-09-11T03:38:40Z","publisher":"Griffith University","source":"research-repository.griffith.edu.au","title":"Problem Framing Canvas Handbook: Making sense of problems for better responses","title-short":"Problem Framing Canvas Handbook","type":"report","URL":"https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/425167"},{"id":"burn-murdochWhyHasntAI2025","author":[{"family":"Burn-Murdoch","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"burn-murdochWhyHasntAI2025","container-title":"Financial Times","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,28]]},"title":"Why hasn’t AI taken your job yet?","type":"article-newspaper"},{"id":"burtEffectNonmyeloablativeHematopoietic2019","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Burt","given":"Richard K."},{"family":"Balabanov","given":"Roumen"},{"family":"Burman","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Sharrack","given":"Basil"},{"family":"Snowden","given":"John A."},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Maria Carolina"},{"family":"Fagius","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Rose","given":"John"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Flavia"},{"family":"Barreira","given":"Amilton Antunes"},{"family":"Carlson","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Han","given":"Xiaoqiang"},{"family":"Moraes","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Quigley","given":"Kathleen"},{"family":"Yaung","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Buckley","given":"Regan"},{"family":"Alldredge","given":"Carri"},{"family":"Clendenan","given":"Allison"},{"family":"Calvario","given":"Michelle A."},{"family":"Henry","given":"Jacquelyn"},{"family":"Jovanovic","given":"Borko"},{"family":"Helenowski","given":"Irene B."}],"citation-key":"burtEffectNonmyeloablativeHematopoietic2019","container-title":"JAMA","container-title-short":"JAMA","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2018.18743","ISSN":"0098-7484","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,15]]},"language":"en","page":"165","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect of Nonmyeloablative Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation vs Continued Disease-Modifying Therapy on Disease Progression in Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial","title-short":"Effect of Nonmyeloablative Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation vs Continued Disease-Modifying Therapy on Disease Progression in Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.2018.18743","volume":"321"},{"id":"burtNonmyeloablativeHematopoieticStem2018","abstract":"Objective: To determine if non-myeloablative HSCT is superior to continuing DMD therapy.Background: We previously reported that non-myeloablative HSCT can be performed safely and is accompanied by long-term improvement in neurological disability in patients with RRMS.Design/Methods: Patients on stable DMDs with &gt; 2 relapses within the prior 12 months were randomized (1:1) to treatment with cyclophosphamide and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin followed by hematopoietic stem cell infusion or to a control arm with continued treatment with the most appropriate DMD as judged by their treating neurologist. The primary endpoint was treatment failure defined as an increase in EDSS, assessed by a blinded evaluating neurologist, by at least 1.0 point sustained for at least 6 months. Patients on DMDs who failed after at least 1 year of treatment were allowed to crossover to HSCT.Results: 110 patients were randomized, 55 to each arm. Three HSCT patients were withdrawn: two for failing enrollment criteria, one for recurrent infections occurring before transplant. Five control patients were withdrawn after soliciting transplants at other centers. No deaths occurred and no CTC grade 4 non-hematopoietic toxicities occurred in the transplant arm. DMDs (number of patients) used in the control arm were: natalizumab (22), dimethyl fumerate (18), fingolimod (13) interferons (10), glatiramer acetate (8), and mitoxantrone (5). Other immune drugs used in the control arm were corticosteroids (39), cyclophosphamide (2) and rituximab (2). With a mean follow up of 3 years (range 1 to 5 years), treatment failure was 60% (30 of 50) for control arm and 6% (3 of 52) for HSCT (P &lt; 0.001).

Reverse genetics and cell biological studies have already established a key role for TRPM7 in the inflammatory activation of macrophages. Advancing TRPM7 as a viable molecular target for immunomodulation requires selective TRPM7 inhibitors with\n            in vivo\n            tolerability and efficacy. Such inhibitors have the potential to interdict inflammatory cascades mediated by systemic and tissue-specialized macrophages. FTY720, an FDA-approved drug for multiple sclerosis inhibits TRPM7. However, FTY720 is a prodrug and its metabolite, FTY720-phosphate, is a potent agonist of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. In this study, we tested non-phosphorylatable FTY720 analogs, which are inert against S1PRs and well tolerated\n            in vivo\n            , for activity against TRPM7 and tissue bioavailability. Using patch clamp electrophysiology, we show that VPC01091.4 and AAL-149 block TRPM7 current at low micromolar concentrations. In culture, they act directly on macrophages to blunt LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine expression, an effect that is predominantly but not solely mediated by TRPM7. We found that VPC01091.4 has significant and rapid accumulation in the brain and lungs, along with direct anti-inflammatory action on alveolar macrophages and microglia. Finally, using a mouse model of endotoxemia, we show VPC01091.4 to be an efficacious anti-inflammatory agent that arrests systemic inflammation\n            in vivo\n            . Together, these findings identify novel small molecule inhibitors that allow TRPM7 channel inhibition independent of S1P receptor targeting. These inhibitors exhibit potent anti-inflammatory properties that are mediated by TRPM7 and likely other molecular targets that remain to be identified.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Busey","given":"Gregory W."},{"family":"Manjegowda","given":"Mohan C."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Iobst","given":"Wesley H."},{"family":"Naphade","given":"Shardul S."},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"Joel A."},{"family":"Doyle","given":"Catherine A."},{"family":"Seegren","given":"Philip V."},{"family":"Lynch","given":"Kevin R."},{"family":"Desai","given":"Bimal N."}],"citation-key":"buseyNovelTRPM7Inhibitors2023","DOI":"10.1101/2023.05.22.541802","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,24]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Immunology","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Novel TRPM7 inhibitors with potent anti-inflammatory effects <i>in vivo</i>","type":"article","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2023.05.22.541802"},{"id":"butterworthAdamantanesTreatmentNeurodegenerative2023","abstract":"Advent of the acute respiratory coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the search for novel antiviral agents and in the repurposing of existing agents with demonstrated efficacy against other known coronaviruses in the search for an agent with antiviral activity for use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MS is a heterogeneous disorder of multiple factors that are mainly associated with the immune system including the breakdown of the blood-brain and spinal cord barriers induced by T cells, B cells, antigen presenting cells, and immune components such as chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The incidence of MS has been increasing worldwide recently, and most therapies related to its treatment are associated with the development of several secondary effects, such as headaches, hepatotoxicity, leukopenia, and some types of cancer; therefore, the search for an effective treatment is ongoing. The use of animal models of MS continues to be an important option for extrapolating new treatments. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) replicates the several pathophysiological features of MS development and clinical signs, to obtain a potential treatment for MS in humans and improve the disease prognosis. Currently, the exploration of neuro-immune-endocrine interactions represents a highlight of interest in the treatment of immune disorders. The arginine vasopressin hormone (AVP) is involved in the increase in blood−brain barrier permeability, inducing the development and aggressiveness of the disease in the EAE model, whereas its deficiency improves the clinical signs of the disease. Therefore, this present review discussed on the use of conivaptan a blocker of AVP receptors type 1a and type 2 (V1a and V2 AVP) in the modulation of immune response without completely depleting its activity, minimizing the adverse effects associated with the conventional therapies becoming a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Calvillo-Robledo","given":"Argelia"},{"family":"Ramírez-Farías","given":"Cynthia"},{"family":"Valdez-Urias","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Huerta-Carreón","given":"Erika P."},{"family":"Quintanar-Stephano","given":"Andrés"}],"citation-key":"calvillo-robledoArginineVasopressinHormone2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

In Parkinson’s disease (PD) models, activation of angiotensin type-1 receptors (AT1) increased the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons, which was inhibited by AT1 blockers (ARBs). This is consistent with recent studies in human brains showing the highest vulnerability of the dopaminergic neurons with the highest rate of the AT1 gene (AGTR1) expression, and retrospective cohort studies showing a reduction of PD risk in patients receiving ARB treatment. Neuroprotective effects of ARBs have also been suggested for Alzheimer’s disease.Methods We recently performed a randomized phase-II 28-week clinical trial of the ARB candesartan in PD. However, the molecular changes induced by ARBs with BBB-penetrating properties such as candesartan in the brain of PD patients remain unexplored. In PD patients, we used a minimally invasive approach to characterize cell– type–specific molecular changes induced by candesartan in the brain. We obtained extracellular vesicles (EVs) from neurons and different types of glial cells within the same blood sample, and the protein content was compared before and after candesartan treatment.Results Candesartan induced the upregulation or downregulation of many proteins relevant to PD progression. These changes were detected in EVs derived from neurons (46 dysregulated proteins), microglia/macrophages (48 dysregulated proteins), astrocytes (22 dysregulated proteins), and oligodendrocytes (92 dysregulated proteins). Altogether, the proteomic changes indicate a coordinated neuroprotective response, involving improved redox and mitochondrial function, enhanced proteostasis and gene regulation, and attenuation of synaptic, metabolic, and inflammatory stress pathways.Conclusion Our proteomic analysis indicates the neuroprotective effects of ARBs such as candesartan on neurons and glial cells in PD patients, highlighting its therapeutic potential and suggesting the need of larger clinical trials for repurposing of these drugs. The results also reveal the potential of the present minimally invasive approach to detect brain cell-type–specific molecular changes and points to a shift in neurodegenerative disease research and monitoring.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialEudraCT number 2016-000679-25Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (PID2021-126848NB-I00; PLEC2022-009401; PID2023-150743OB-I00), Instituto de Salud Carlos III (Intramural competitive research grant from CIBERNED); Galician Government (XUGA, ED431C 2022/41) and FEDER (Regional European Development Fund).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sant Pau University Hospital, Barcelona, and was registered in the European Clinical Trials Register under EudraCT number 2016-000679-25 (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2016-000679-25/ES).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group, 2-year study, 181 patients with RRMS were randomized 1:1. Key inclusion criteria were a low serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) concentration (<75 nmol/L), a treatment with interferon beta-1a 44 μg (SC 3 times per week) 4 months ± 2 months before randomization, and at least one documented relapse during the previous 2 years. Patients received high-dose oral cholecalciferol 100,000 IU or placebo every other week for 96 weeks. Primary outcome measure was the change in the annualized relapse rate (ARR) at 96 weeks. Secondary objectives included safety and tolerability of cholecalciferol and efficacy assessments (ARR, MRI parameters, and Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]). RESULTS: The primary end point was not met. In patients who completed the 2-year follow-up (45 with cholecalciferol and 45 with placebo), all efficacy parameters favored cholecalciferol with an ARR reduction (p = 0.012), less new hypointense T1-weighted lesions (p = 0.025), a lower volume of hypointense T1-weighted lesions (p = 0.031), and a lower progression of EDSS (p = 0.026). The overall rate of adverse events was well balanced between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary end point was not met, these data suggest a potential treatment effect of cholecalciferol in patients with RRMS already treated with interferon beta-1a and low serum 25OHD concentration. Together with the good safety profile, these data support the exploration of cholecalciferol treatment in such patients with RRMS. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01198132.

Identification of small molecules to inhibit pyroptosis is emerging as an attractive strategy. In this study, we performed a screening based on in silico docking of compounds on the reported Gasdermin D (GSDMD) three-dimensional structure and found C202-2729 demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory effects in both endotoxin shock and EAE mouse models. Oral administration of C202-2729 was capable of attenuating EAE disease severity significantly and has the comparable effects to teriflunomide, the first-line clinical drug of multiple sclerosis. We found C202-2729 remarkably suppressed macrophage and T cell–associated immune inflammation. Mechanistically, C202-2729 neither impact GSDMD cleavage nor the upstream inflammasome activation in mouse immortalized bone marrow–derived macrophages. However, C202-2729 exposure significantly repressed the IL-1β secretion and cell pyroptosis. We found C202-2729 directly bonds to the N terminus of GSDMD and blocks the migration of the N-terminal GSDMD fragment to cell membrane, restraining the pore-forming and mature IL-1β release. Collectively, our findings provide a new molecule with the potential for translational application in GSDMD-associated inflammatory diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Cao","given":"Runjing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zihao"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Chuyu"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Senlin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yahui"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Xiaohong"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Meiling"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chenhui"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jingwei"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Cun-Jin"}],"citation-key":"caoIdentificationSmallMolecule2022","container-title":"The Journal of Immunology","DOI":"10.4049/jimmunol.2100977","ISSN":"0022-1767, 1550-6606","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,15]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/pages/standard-publication-reuse-rights","page":"820-828","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Identification of a Small Molecule with Strong Anti-Inflammatory Activity in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis and Sepsis through Blocking Gasdermin D Activation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jimmunol/article/209/4/820/7924809","volume":"209"},{"id":"capetMarburgMultipleSclerosis2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Capet","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Levraut","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Delourme","given":"Adrien"},{"family":"Thomel-Rocchi","given":"Oceane"},{"family":"Bourg","given":"Véronique"},{"family":"Cabre","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Vandenbos","given":"Fanny"},{"family":"Mondot","given":"Lydiane"},{"family":"Lebrun-Frenay","given":"Christine"}],"citation-key":"capetMarburgMultipleSclerosis2022","container-title":"Neurology and Therapy","container-title-short":"Neurol Ther","DOI":"10.1007/s40120-021-00308-6","ISSN":"2193-8253, 2193-6536","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","page":"507-513","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Marburg Multiple Sclerosis Variant: Complete Remission with Very Early Administration of Mitoxantrone—A Case Report","title-short":"Marburg Multiple Sclerosis Variant","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40120-021-00308-6","volume":"11"},{"id":"caprarielloLandscapeTargetsLead2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Caprariello","given":"Andrew V."},{"family":"Adams","given":"Drew J."}],"citation-key":"caprarielloLandscapeTargetsLead2022","container-title":"Nature Chemical Biology","container-title-short":"Nat Chem Biol","DOI":"10.1038/s41589-022-01115-2","ISSN":"1552-4450, 1552-4469","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"en","page":"925-933","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The landscape of targets and lead molecules for remyelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01115-2","volume":"18"},{"id":"carlettosMindfulnessbasedInterventionsImprovement2020","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The study aims to meta-analytically review studies about the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on well-being of people with multiple sclerosis (MS).

The Vitamin D to Ameliorate MS (VIDAMS) trial is a multi-center, randomized controlled, double blind trial assessing if high dose vitamin D supplementation as an add-on to first-line therapy reduces disease activity in people with relapsing-remitting (RR) MS. Objectives/Aims: To determine if high dose compared to low dose vitamin D3, as add-on to glatiramer acetate (GA), is associated with a decreased risk of clinical relapse (primary outcome) or other clinical or imaging measures of MS activity in people with RRMS. Methods: People aged 18 to 50 years with RRMS (2010 criteria) and recent disease activity were enrolled at sixteen neurology clinics in the United States. Key additional eligibility criteria included Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score< 4.0; minimum serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 15 ng/ml within 30 days of screening, and no more than an average of 1000 IU supplemental vitamin D3daily (in addition to multivitamin) within 90 days of screening. After screening and a 30-day run-in of daily 20 mg subcutaneous GA injections, those with adequate adherence (< 3 missed injections) were randomized 1:1 to low dose vitamin D3(LDVD; 600 International Units (IU)/day) or high dose Vitamin D3(HDVD; 5000 IU/day) and were followed every 12 weeks for up to 96 weeks. Treating clinicians and participants were blinded to study drug assignment; outcomes assessors were also blinded to participants' clinical course. The primary outcome was analyzed using Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: 172 participants (83 LDVD vs. 89 HDVD) were randomized, 165 returned for> 1 study visit and were included in the analysis according to their assigned treatment and 140 completed a week 96 visit. The proportion that experienced a confirmed relapse did not differ between LDVD and HDVD arms [at 96 weeks: 32% vs. 34%, p=0.60; hazard ratio (HR): 1.17 (0.67, 2.05), p=0.57]. Annualized relapse rate did not differ between LDVD and HDVD arms [0.20 (0.11, 0.35) vs. 0.34 (0.20, 0.56), p=0.07; HR: 1.70 (0.97, 2.97), p=0.06].

It has been demonstrated that extracts of Tagetes lucida have immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects. This work induced motor damage and neuroinflammation in male BALB/c mice by oral administration of cuprizone (CPZ) (40 mg/kg) for five weeks. In addition, the extracts and coumarins of Tagetes lucida (25 mg/kg) were used to control these damage variables; during the experiment, animals were subject to behavioral tests, and at the end of 5 weeks, mice from each group were used to measure the integrity of biological barriers (brain, kidneys, and spleen) through the extravasation test with blue Evans dye. In another group of animals, the ELISA method measured the brain concentrations of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-α. The results presented here allow us to conclude that the extracts and coumarins IC, HN, PE, DF, and SC of Tagetes lucida exert a neuroprotective effect by controlling the motor damage and neuroinflammation by increasing the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 and decreasing IL-1β and TNF-α; notably, these treatments also protect organs from vascular permeability increase, mainly the BBB, in mice with CPZ-induced experimental encephalomyelitis (VEH * p < 0.05).

Oral administration of ORY-2001 ameliorated clinical signs, reduced lymphocyte egress and infiltration of immune cells into the spinal cord, and prevented demyelination. Interestingly, ORY-2001 was more effective and/or faster acting than a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor antagonist in the effector phase of the disease and reduced the inflammatory gene expression signature characteristic ofEAE in the CNS of mice more potently. In addition, ORY-2001 induced gene expression changes concordant with a potential neuroprotective function in the brain and spinal cord and reduced neuronal glutamate excitotoxicity-derived damage in explants.

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are among the most studied interventions, although few well-conducted studies have tested them in this field. Furthermore, the participation in typical MBIs may be impaired by time and logistics. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the efficacy of an online MBI to improve QOL, psychological well-being, sleep, and fatigue. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial, in which 139 participants were randomly assigned to an MS-specific online mindfulness meditation intervention or to a psychoeducational (active control) group. Participants were assessed for QOL, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and fatigue, at three different times: at recruitment, after 2 months, and after 6 months. RESULTS: In comparison to the control group, the experimental subjects reported higher QOL and lower depression, anxiety, and sleep problems at the end of intervention. However, after 6 months these group differences were no longer significant. CONCLUSION: An online MBI could be an effective psychological treatment for the promotion of well-being in MS in short-term. However, the lack of lasting effects requires the development of new strategies to support long-term changes.","author":[{"literal":"Cavalera C"},{"literal":"Rovaris M"},{"literal":"Mendozzi L"},{"literal":"Pugnetti L"},{"literal":"Garegnani M"},{"literal":"Castelnuovo G"},{"literal":"Molinari E"},{"literal":"Pagnini F"}],"citation-key":"cavaleracOnlineMeditationTraining2019","container-title":"Mult Scler","DOI":"10.1177/1352458518761187","ISSN":"1352-4585","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"610-617","title":"Online meditation training for people with multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled trial","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458518761187","volume":"25"},{"id":"caverzasiMWFCorpusCallosum2023","abstract":"Myelin repair is an unrealized therapeutic goal in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Uncertainty remains about the optimal techniques for assessing therapeutic efficacy and imaging biomarkers are required to measure and corroborate myelin restoration. We analyzed myelin water fraction imaging from ReBUILD, a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled (delayed treatment) remyelination trial, that showed a significant reduction in VEP latency in patients with MS. We focused on brain regions rich in myelin. Fifty MS subjects in two arms underwent 3T MRI at baseline and months 3 and 5. Half of the cohort was randomly assigned to receive treatment from baseline through 3 mo, whereas the other half received treatment from 3 mo to 5 mo post-baseline. We computed myelin water fraction changes occurring in normal-appearing white matter of corpus callosum, optic radiations, and corticospinal tracts. An increase in myelin water fraction was documented in the normal-appearing white matter of the corpus callosum, in correspondence with the administration of the remyelinating treatment clemastine. This study provides direct, biologically validated imaging-based evidence of medically induced myelin repair. Moreover, our work strongly suggests that significant myelin repair occurs outside of lesions. We therefore propose myelin water fraction within the normal-appearing white matter of the corpus callosum as a biomarker for clinical trials looking at remyelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Caverzasi","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Papinutto","given":"Nico"},{"family":"Cordano","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Kirkish","given":"Gina"},{"family":"Gundel","given":"Tristan J."},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Alyssa"},{"family":"Akula","given":"Amit Vijay"},{"family":"Boscardin","given":"W.

In this research (N = 2,476), we show that the structure of online sharing built into social platforms is more important than individual deficits in critical reasoning and partisan bias—commonly cited drivers of misinformation. Due to the reward-based learning systems on social media, users form habits of sharing information that attracts others' attention. Once habits form, information sharing is automatically activated by cues on the platform without users considering response outcomes such as spreading misinformation. As a result of user habits, 30 to 40% of the false news shared in our research was due to the 15% most habitual news sharers. Suggesting that sharing of false news is part of a broader response pattern established by social media platforms, habitual users also shared information that challenged their own political beliefs. Finally, we show that sharing of false news is not an inevitable consequence of user habits: Social media sites could be restructured to build habits to share accurate information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ceylan","given":"Gizem"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Ian A."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Wendy"}],"citation-key":"ceylanSharingMisinformationHabitual2023","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2216614120","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,24]]},"page":"e2216614120","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Sharing of misinformation is habitual, not just lazy or biased","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2216614120","volume":"120"},{"id":"chabotCytokineProductionLymphocytemicroglia2002","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chabot","given":"S"},{"family":"Yong","given":"Fp"},{"family":"Le","given":"Dm"},{"family":"Metz","given":"Lm"},{"family":"Myles","given":"T"},{"family":"Yong","given":"Vw"}],"citation-key":"chabotCytokineProductionLymphocytemicroglia2002","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis","DOI":"10.1191/1352458502ms810oa","ISSN":"14770970, 13524585","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",8,1]]},"page":"299-306","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cytokine production in T lymphocytemicroglia interaction is attenuated by glatiramer acetate: a mechanism for therapeutic efficacy in multiple sclerosis","title-short":"Cytokine production in T lymphocytemicroglia interaction is attenuated by glatiramer acetate","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://msj.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1191/1352458502ms810oa","volume":"8"},{"id":"chakamianImmunosuppressiveEffectsTwo2023","abstract":"T cells play an important role in the development and progression of multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system.

The structural brain phenotype characteristically shows T2-white matter hyperintensities, particularly in the thalamus and basal ganglia, and previous diffusion MRI studies have demonstrated widespread white matter microstructural differences, suggesting aberrant myelination in NF1. However, no previous studies have investigated quantitative myelin in NF1. The aim of this study is to compare quantitative myelination in NF1 compared to neurotypical controls, and examine the relationship between myelin and working memory performance in children with NF1.Methods and materials The T1-weighted and T2-weighted structural MRI images were acquired from 48 children and adolescents with NF1 aged 11-18 years. These were compared to data from 168 age- and gender-matched neurotypical controls drawn from the Human Connectome Project. Visuospatial n-back tasks were used to measure the working memory performance in the NF1 cohort. Pituitary depth was used as a covariate to control for pubertal differences.Results Compared to neurotypicals, children with NF1 showed significantly reduced grey matter/white matter myelin ratios both throughout the brain and within each of the four major cerebral lobes. The stratified age-related whole-brain myelin differences were reduced in NF1 relative to controls. The sex-related whole-brain myelin differences were found to be greater in females than in males. However, no significant correlation was found between myelin and working memory performance in NF1. Pituitary depth was reduced in NF1 relative to controls.Conclusion The reduced grey matter/white matter (GM/WM) myelin ratios in the whole brain and the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes suggests a widespread disruption of cerebral myelination in NF1. The age and sex-related myelin differences, and associated differences in developmental trajectories, may occur due to the effects of gonadal hormones but needs to be examined in future studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementVAC was funded by the NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR203308).

While fasting is increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic intervention in neurology and psychiatry, its impact upon the BBB has not been studied. This study was designed to assess the global impact of fasting upon the repertoire of BBB transporters.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                We used a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments to assess the response of the brain endothelium in male rats that were fed\n                ad libitum\n                or fasted for one to three days. Brain endothelial cells were acutely purified and transcriptionaly profiled using RNA-Seq. Isolated brain microvessels were used to assess the protein expression of selected BBB transporters through western blot.

These included the ketone bodies transporter MCT1, which is pivotal for the brain adaptation to fasting. Our findings in vivo suggested that PPAR δ, a major lipid sensor, was selectively activated in brain endothelial cells in response to fasting. This was confirmed in vitro where pharmacological agonists and free fatty acids selectively activated PPAR δ, resulting in the upregulation of MCT1 expression. Moreover, dosing rats with a specific PPAR δ antagonist blocked the upregulation of MCT1 expression and activity induced by fasting.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Altogether, our study shows that fasting affects a selected set of BBB transporters which does not include the main drug efflux transporters.

Based on a large language model, it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's valuation to $29 billion. ChatGPT's release spurred the development of competing products, including Bard, Ernie Bot, LLaMA, Claude, and Grok. Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. Some observers raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, both of which are members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning. ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version, while the more advanced GPT-4-based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".\nChatGPT is credited with starting the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid and unprecedented development in the field of artificial intelligence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,25]]},"citation-key":"ChatGPT2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,25]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1191694867","source":"Wikipedia","title":"ChatGPT","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ChatGPT&oldid=1191694867"},{"id":"ChatGPTHasBig","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"citation-key":"ChatGPTHasBig","title":"ChatGPT Has a Big Privacy Problem | WIRED","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.wired.com/story/italy-ban-chatgpt-privacy-gdpr/"},{"id":"chaytowTargetingPhosphoglycerateKinase2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chaytow","given":"Helena"},{"family":"Carroll","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"David"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yu-Ting"},{"family":"Van Der Hoorn","given":"Dinja"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Hannah Louise"},{"family":"Becker","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Becker","given":"Catherina Gwynne"},{"family":"Faller","given":"Kiterie Maud Edwige"},{"family":"Talbot","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Gillingwater","given":"Thomas Henry"}],"citation-key":"chaytowTargetingPhosphoglycerateKinase2022","container-title":"eBioMedicine","container-title-short":"eBioMedicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.104202","ISSN":"23523964","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"en","page":"104202","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Targeting phosphoglycerate kinase 1 with terazosin improves motor neuron phenotypes in multiple models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S235239642200384X","volume":"83"},{"id":"cheDiscoveryNewMacrophage2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Che","given":"Jinxin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Wenxiang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Longling"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Mingfei"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Jialiang"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Lexian"},{"family":"Weng","given":"Qinjie"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiajia"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Xiaowu"}],"citation-key":"cheDiscoveryNewMacrophage2022","container-title":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","container-title-short":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejmech.2022.114732","ISSN":"02235234","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"en","page":"114732","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Discovery of new macrophage M2 polarization modulators as multiple sclerosis treatment agents that enable the inflammation microenvironment remodeling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0223523422006341","volume":"243"},{"id":"cheliTransferrinReceptorNecessary2023","abstract":"To test the hypothesis that the transferrin (\n              Tf\n              ) cycle has unique importance for oligodendrocyte development and function, we disrupted the expression of the Tf receptor (\n              Tfr\n              ) gene in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (\n              OPCs\n              ) on mice of either sex using the\n              Cre/lox\n              system. This ablation results in the elimination of iron incorporation via the Tf cycle but leaves other Tf functions intact. Mice lacking Tfr, specifically in NG2 or Sox10-positive OPCs, developed a hypomyelination phenotype. Both OPCs differentiation and myelination were affected, and Tfr deletion resulted in impaired OPC iron absorption. Specifically, the brains of Tfr cKO animals presented a reduction in the quantity of myelinated axons, as well as fewer mature oligodendrocytes. In contrast, the ablation of Tfr in adult mice affected neither mature oligodendrocytes nor myelin synthesis. RNA-seq analysis performed in Tfr cKO OPCs revealed misregulated genes involved in OPC maturation, myelination, and mitochondrial activity. Tfr deletion in cortical OPCs also disrupted the activity of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, epigenetic mechanisms critical for gene transcription and the expression of structural mitochondrial genes. RNA-seq studies were additionally conducted in OPCs in which iron storage was disrupted by deleting the ferritin heavy chain. These OPCs display abnormal regulation of genes associated with iron transport, antioxidant activity, and mitochondrial activity. Thus, our results indicate that the Tf cycle is central for iron homeostasis in OPCs during postnatal development and suggest that both iron uptake via Tfr and iron storage in ferritin are critical for energy production, mitochondrial activity, and maturation of postnatal OPCs.\n            \n            \n              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:\n            \n            \n              By knocking-out transferrin receptor (\n              Tfr\n              ) specifically in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (\n              OPCs\n              ) we have established that iron incorporation via the Tf cycle is key for OPC iron homeostasis and for the normal function of these cells during the postnatal development of the CNS.

brain injury (mTBI) disproportionately affects children and adolescents and has been associated with poorer neurocognitive performance, but the variability in acute and chronic symptoms presents challenges in understanding the biological mechanisms underlying symptom heterogeneity and predicting these effects in clinical settings. We hypothesized that genetic factors interact with mTBI to determine vulnerability or resistance to neurological dysfunction post-mTBI. We leveraged the baseline Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort to conduct a gene-by-mTBI genome-wide association study (GWAS) to study the interaction between mTBI and genetics in learning and memory compared to orthopedic injury controls. The GWAS revealed significant biological pathways involved in mitochondrial function and synaptic signaling that are enriched for SNPs showing evidence of interaction with mTBI. Integration of the gene-by-mTBI pathways from ABCD with cell-type specific gene regulatory networks built from single-cell RNA sequencing data from the Allen Brain Atlas uncovered key driver genes such as APP, MAPT, and MOG which coordinate between cell types in hippocampus and cortex to regulate these pathways. Lastly, we performed polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis on these pathways to assess their clinical value in predicting learning and memory outcomes in the ABCD cohort, revealing a statistically significant contribution but limited clinical benefit. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic modifiers of mTBI pathology and propose potential therapeutic candidates at pathway and network levels.Author Summary Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, is prevalent in adolescents and can have lasting impact on brain development, learning, and memory. However, the high variability in injury outcomes presents major challenges in predicting the specific recovery trajectories in individual children. Our study examines the entire genome to uncover genetic factors underlying mTBI response that determine an individual’s vulnerability to cognitive deficits. By investigating the interaction between genetics and injury, we aim to pinpoint how genetic predispositions affect biological processes in brain injury recovery to determine disease severity.Our findings revealed certain genetic factors that are related to learning and memory in individuals with mTBI, but not in those with orthopedic injuries. These factors affect crucial areas of brain recovery, including neuronal repair and metabolism. We identified the core genes that coordinate across different brain cell types to affect these biological pathways. Finally, we leveraged these genetic factors to predict learning and memory performance in mTBI patients.By examining the biological mechanisms driven by the genetic-mTBI interaction, we provide novel insights into the complex relationships between genetics, brain injury, and cognitive function. Our study provides a data-driven framework to understand how genetic and environmental factors interact to influence disease outcomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by NICHD R01 HD105338 (to J.M., X.Y.), NINDS R01 NS111378 and R01 NS117148 (to X.Y), NIDA U01 DA041089 (to J.J.), and the UCLA Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology Hyde Fellowship (to M.C).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All ABCD data was accessed through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) data archive (NDA).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

However, the role and underlying mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) are still unclear.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The protein expressions of the NLRP3 inflammasome including NLRP3, cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-1 (caspase-1) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionicacid receptor (AMPAR) subunit, and the ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), were determined by Western blotting. The interaction between p97 and AMPA glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1) was determined by co-immunoprecipitation. The histopathological level of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) was determined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting were used to confirm the genotype of the knockout mice. Motor functions, including myodynamia and coordination, were evaluated by using grasping and rotarod tests. Hippocampus-dependent spatial cognitive function was measured by using the Morris-water maze (MWM).\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We reported that the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, such as NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1β, was activated in rats with HIBD and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated cultured primary neurons. Further studies showed that the protein level of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit on the hippocampal postsynaptic membrane was significantly decreased in rats with HIBD, and it could be restored to control levels after treatment with the specific caspase-1 inhibitor AC-YVAD-CMK.

Importantly, we showed that OGD treatment obviously enhanced the interaction between p97 and GluA1, while AC-YVAD-CMK treatment promoted the dissociation of p97 from the GluA1 complex and consequently facilitated the localization of GluA1 on the plasma membrane of cultured primary neurons.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients often suffer from neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD). The utility of SNM in the MS population is limited by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) incompatibility as routine MRIs to evaluate for disease progression are required. The Axonics System is the first Food and Drug Administration‐approved SNM device that is 1.5/3 T full‐body MRI‐conditionally safe.

We previously reported that prolonging the ISR protects remyelinating oligodendrocytes and promotes remyelination in the presence of inflammation (Chen et al.,\n            eLife\n            , 2021). However, the exact mechanisms through which this occurs remain unknown. Here, we investigated whether the ISR modulator Sephin1 in combination with the oligodendrocyte differentiation enhancing reagent bazedoxifene (BZA) is able to accelerate remyelination under inflammation, and the underlying mechanisms mediating this pathway. We find that the combined treatment of Sephin1 and BZA is sufficient to accelerate early-stage remyelination in mice with ectopic IFN-γ expression in the CNS. IFN-γ, which is a critical inflammatory cytokine in multiple sclerosis (MS), inhibits oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation in culture and triggers a mild ISR. Mechanistically, we further show that BZA promotes OPC differentiation in the presence of IFN-γ, while Sephin1 enhances the IFN-γ-induced ISR by reducing protein synthesis and increasing RNA stress granule formation in differentiating oligodendrocytes. Finally, the ISR suppressor 2BAct is able to partially lessen the beneficial effect of Sephin1 on disease progression, in an MS mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Overall, our findings uncover distinct mechanisms of action of BZA and Sephin1 on oligodendrocyte lineage cells under inflammatory stress, suggesting that a combination therapy may effectively promote restoring neuronal function in MS patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yanan"},{"family":"Quan","given":"Songhua"},{"family":"Patil","given":"Vaibhav"},{"family":"Kunjamma","given":"Rejani B."},{"family":"Tokars","given":"Haley M."},{"family":"Leisten","given":"Eric D."},{"family":"Chan","given":"Jonah"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Yvette"},{"family":"Popko","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"chenInsightsMechanismOligodendrocyte2023","DOI":"10.1101/2023.01.23.525156","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,23]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Neuroscience","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Insights into the mechanism of oligodendrocyte protection and remyelination enhancement by the integrated stress response","type":"article","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2023.01.23.525156"},{"id":"chenNeurologicalUpdateCognitive2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Michelle H."},{"family":"Chiaravalloti","given":"Nancy D."},{"family":"DeLuca","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"chenNeurologicalUpdateCognitive2021","container-title":"Journal of Neurology","container-title-short":"J Neurol","DOI":"10.1007/s00415-021-10618-2","ISSN":"0340-5354, 1432-1459","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"4908-4914","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neurological update: cognitive rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis","title-short":"Neurological update","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10618-2","volume":"268"},{"id":"chenPhosphodiesterase7PDE7Unique2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wen-zhi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Dong"},{"family":"Skaggs","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Han-Ting"}],"citation-key":"chenPhosphodiesterase7PDE7Unique2021","container-title":"Neuropharmacology","container-title-short":"Neuropharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuropharm.2021.108694","ISSN":"00283908","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"en","page":"108694","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Phosphodiesterase 7(PDE7): A unique drug target for central nervous system diseases","title-short":"Phosphodiesterase 7(PDE7)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0028390821002495","volume":"196"},{"id":"chenPositiveNegativeCell2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Di"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Hongyun"},{"family":"Saberi","given":"Hooshang"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Hari Shanker"}],"citation-key":"chenPositiveNegativeCell2023","container-title":"International Review of Neurobiology","DOI":"10.1016/bs.irn.2023.05.017","ISBN":"978-0-323-99777-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"241-254","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Positive and negative cell therapy in randomized control trials for central nervous system diseases","type":"chapter","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0074774223000454","volume":"171"},{"id":"chenRecentAdvancesRole2024","abstract":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), recognized for their self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capabilities, have garnered considerable wide attention since their discovery in bone marrow. Recent studies have underscored the potential of MSCs in immune regulation, particularly in the context of autoimmune diseases, which arise from immune system imbalances and necessitate long-term treatment. Traditional immunosuppressive drugs, while effective, can lead to drug tolerance and adverse effects, including a heightened risk of infections and malignancies. Consequently, adjuvant therapy incorporating MSCs has emerged as a promising new treatment strategy, leveraging their immunomodulatory properties. This paper reviews the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs and their application in autoimmune diseases, highlighting their potential to regulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. The immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs are primarily mediated through direct cell contact and paracrine activity with immune cells. This review lays the groundwork for the broader clinical application of MSCs in the future and underscores their significant scientific value and application prospects. Further research is expected to enhance the efficacy and safety of MSCs-based treatments for autoimmune diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Baiyu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhilei"},{"family":"He","given":"Mengfei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lijie"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Longyan"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Lingling"}],"citation-key":"chenRecentAdvancesRole2024","container-title":"Frontiers in Immunology","container-title-short":"Front.

It causes numerous symptoms, including tingling, fatigue, muscle spasms, cognitive deficits, and neuropsychiatric disorders. This disease significantly worsens quality of life (QoL), and this dimension of general functioning provides valuable information about the effectiveness of treatment and well-being. There are psychological interventions that can improve QoL, but their number is limited. Therefore, searching for new methods that are as effective and safe as possible is ongoing. Methods: This review examines the potential effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in improving the quality of life in patients with MS. Searches were conducted in the PubMed/Medline, Research Gate, and Cochrane databases. Results: The search yielded seven studies in which QoL was a primary or secondary outcome. Stimulation protocols displayed heterogeneity, especially concerning the choice of the stimulation site. Four studies demonstrated the effectiveness of tDCS in improving QoL, all of which (two) used anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC. Stimulation of the motor cortex has produced mixed results. The potential mechanisms of action of tDCS in improving QoL in MS are explained. These include improved synaptic plasticity, increased cerebral blood flow, salience network engagement through tDCS, and reduction of beta-amyloid deposition. The limitations are also detailed, and recommendations for future research are made. Conclusions: While the evidence is limited, tDCS has shown potential to improve QoL in MS patients in some studies. Prefrontal stimulation appears promising, and further research is recommended to explore this approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chmiel","given":"James"},{"family":"Kurpas","given":"Donata"},{"family":"Stępień-Słodkowska","given":"Marta"}],"citation-key":"chmielPotentialTranscranialDirect2025","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","container-title-short":"JCM","DOI":"10.3390/jcm14020373","ISSN":"2077-0383","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,9]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"373","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Potential of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in Improving Quality of Life in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: A Review and Discussion of Mechanisms of Action","title-short":"The Potential of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in Improving Quality of Life in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/14/2/373","volume":"14"},{"id":"chopraDifferentialEffectsIllness2025","abstract":"Introduction Cortical grey matter loss is a common finding in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies of people with psychosis and has been shown to progress with ongoing illness. A major unresolved question concerns whether these changes are driven by the illness itself or represent iatrogenic effects of antipsychotic medication.Methods We report findings from a triple-blind randomised placebo-controlled MRI study where 62 antipsychotic- naïve people with first episode psychosis (FEP) received either an atypical antipsychotic or a placebo pill over a treatment period of 6 months. A healthy control group (n=27) was also recruited. Anatomical T1-weighed scans were collected at baseline, 3-months, and 12-months. Linear mixed effects models were fitted to &gt;160,000 cortical surface loci to examine illness- and antipsychotic-related changes in cortical thickness. We also examined whether cortical changes were enriched within canonical functional networks or cytoarchitectonic types of laminar differentiation, and whether these changes spatially correlated with normative in vivo receptor/transporter densities via PET imaging and ex vivo transcriptomically-imputed cell densities.Results We found widespread cortical thinning over 12 months (p&lt;.05FDR) in people with FEP who received placebo compared to healthy controls, with the largest effects occurring in frontal, cingulate, and occipital areas. No significant difference was detected in antipsychotic-treated people with FEP compared to healthy controls. Thickness differences in placebo group were not preferentially concentrated within any specific functional networks, although highly differentiated koniocortical areas were relatively protected from cortical thinning (pspin&lt;.05FDR). Thinning in the placebo group spatially aligned with normative distributions of GABAA/BZ, 5HT1B, 5HT2A, and H3 receptors (.17 &lt; r &lt; .28; pspin&lt;.05FDR). No significant associations between cortical thinning and symptom changes were identified.Conclusions Widespread thinning of cortical grey matter occurs over the first year of FEP in people who do not receive antipsychotic treatment. No such thinning is evident in patients receiving antipsychotics during the study intervention phase. These findings suggest that cortical thinning in the early stages of psychosis is an illness-related phenomenon that may be mitigated by early antipsychotic exposure.Competing Interest StatementJanssen-Cilag partially supported the early years of this study with an unrestricted investigator-initiated grant and provided risperidone, paliperidone, and matched placebo for the first 30 participants.

Gene enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the biological processes with enriched genes in regions showing atrophy. Annotation mapping was used to identify the neurochemical systems whose density maps matched atrophy in MSA.Results Atrophy in MSA was found to primarily affect deep brain regions, including the cerebellar white matter, pons, putamen, olive nuclei, and substantia nigra. PLS regression on deep brain region atrophy identified two gene expression latent variables, explaining 27.5% of the covariance. Regions with greater atrophy overexpressed genes related to the mitochondrial respiratory chain, particularly proton transmembrane transport and complex I assembly. In addition, cell type analysis revealed that regions with atrophy overexpressed genes related to oligodendrocytes. These patterns were distinct from those found in Parkinson’s disease. Atrophic regions in MSA also displayed less serotonin and GABA receptors and more acetylcholine and noradrenaline receptors.Interpretation Regions showing atrophy in MSA show specific features, namely overexpression of genes related to mitochondrial function and oligodendrocytes and distinct neurochemical patterns. This study highlights some of the biological and neurochemical mechanisms underlying selective vulnerability of brain regions in MSA.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by grants from Agence Nationale de la Recherche (grant numbers ANR 11 INBS 0006 [France Life Imaging], ANR 11 INBS 0011 [NeurATRIS, Investissements d Avenir], ANR 19 P3IA 0001 [PRAIRIE 3IA Institute], and ANR 10 IAIHU 06 [IHU Paris Institute of Neurosciences]), the European Union (EU) Framework Project 6 GENEPARK: Genomic Biomarkers for Parkinson s Disease, Action Line: LIFESCIHEALTH Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health (LSH 2005 1.2.2.2) Development of Innovative methods for diagnosis of nervous system disorders, the Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique [grant Numbers: PHRC 2007 A00169 44 (LRRK) and PHRC 2004 (BBBIPPS), Association France Parkinson, Ecole Neuroscience de Paris, Electricite de France (Fondation d Entreprise EDF), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Fondation Therese and Rene Planiol pour l etude du Cerveau, Societe Francaise de Radiologie (SFR) / College des Enseignants en Radiologie de France (CERF), and Societe Francaise de Neuroradiologie (SFNR).

Axon lesions often lead to permanent impairment of motor and cognitive functions and the interaction with the outside world.

Understanding the roles of neurotrophic factors and their molecular mechanisms on neuro-regeneration will not only benefit patients with neural damage but could potentially treat neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this study, we showed that human IL12 p40-p40 homodimer (hIL12p80) within PLA and PLGA conduits improved sciatic nerve regeneration in mice. As such, the group of conduits with NSCs and hIL12p80 (CNI) showed the best recovery among the groups in the sciatic functional index (SFI), compound muscle action potential (CMAP), and Rotarod performance analyses. In addition, the CNI group had a faster recovery and outperformed the other groups in SFI and Rotarod performance tests beginning in the fourth week post-surgery. Immunohistochemistry showed that the CNI group increased the diameter of the newly regenerated nerve by two-fold (p < 0.01). In vitro studies showed that hIL12p80 stimulated differentiation of mouse NSCs to oligodendrocyte lineages through phosphorylation of Stat3 at Y705 and S727. Furthermore, implantation using PLGA conduits (C2.0 and C2.1) showed better recovery in the Rotarod test and CMAP than using PLA conduits in FVB mice. In B6 mice, the group with C2.1 + NSCs + hIL12p80 (C2.1NI) not only promoted sciatic functional recovery but also reduced the rate of experimental autotomy. These results suggested that hIL12p80, combined with NSCs, enhanced the functional recovery and accelerated the regeneration of damaged nerves in the sciatic nerve injury mice. Our findings could further shed light on IL12′s application not only in damaged nerves but also in rectifying the oligodendrocytes’ defects in neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chung","given":"Yu-Fen"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jong-Hang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ching-Wen"},{"family":"Hsu","given":"Hui-Yu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ya-Ping"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chiao-Chan"},{"family":"Chiu","given":"Ing-Ming"}],"citation-key":"chungHumanIL12p80Promotes2022","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms23137002","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,23]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"7002","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Human IL12p80 Promotes Murine Oligodendrocyte Differentiation to Repair Nerve Injury","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/13/7002","volume":"23"},{"id":"chunTransplantationMesenchymalStem2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Considerable experimental and clinical evidences have proved that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) transplantation was powerful in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment.

Vestibular rehabilitation studies demonstrate not only improvements in balance but fatigue also, suggesting a relationship between central vestibular integration and fatigue. The objective of this study was to determine whether the relationship between balance and fatigue in people with MS is seen between other measures of central vestibular integration and fatigue and to understand how central vestibular integration measures interrelate.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This cross-sectional study consisted of 40 people with MS (age = 27–55 years, Expanded Disability Severity Scale score = 1.0–6.5) who completed vestibular ocular reflex testing, subjective visual vertical testing, static posturography, dynamic gait, 2 self-report fatigue surveys, and a 6-Minute Walk Test to assess walking capacity/physical fatigue was completed.

OBJECTIVE: To compare Sativex with placebo in relieving symptoms of spasticity due to MS. METHODS: A 15-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 337 subjects with MS spasticity not fully relieved with current anti-spasticity therapy. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was a spasticity 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS). Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed a non-significant improvement in NRS score, in favor of Sativex. The per protocol (PP) population (79% of subjects) change in NRS score and responder analyses (> or =30% improvement from baseline) were both significantly superior for Sativex, compared with placebo: -1.3 versus -0.8 points (change from baseline, p=0.035); and 36% versus 24% (responders, p=0.040). These were supported by the time to response (ITT: p=0.068; PP: p=0.025) analyses, carer global impression of change assessment (p=0.013) and timed 10-meter walk (p=0.042). Among the subjects who achieved a > or =30% response in spasticity with Sativex, 98, 94 and 73% reported improvements of 10, 20 and 30%, respectively, at least once during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Sativex was generally well tolerated, with most adverse events reported being mild-to-moderate in severity. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The 0-10 NRS and responder PP analyses demonstrated that Sativex treatment resulted in a significant reduction in treatment-resistant spasticity, in subjects with advanced MS and severe spasticity. The response observed within the first 4 weeks of treatment appears to be a useful aid to prediction of responder/non-responder status.","author":[{"literal":"Collin C"},{"literal":"Ehler E"},{"literal":"Waberzinek G"},{"literal":"Alsindi Z"},{"literal":"Davies P"},{"literal":"Powell K"},{"literal":"Notcutt W"},{"literal":"O'Leary C"},{"literal":"Ratcliffe S"},{"literal":"Nováková I"},{"literal":"Zapletalova O"},{"literal":"Piková J"},{"literal":"Ambler Z"}],"citation-key":"collincDoubleblindRandomizedPlacebocontrolled2010","container-title":"Neurol Res","DOI":"10.1179/016164109X12590518685660","ISSN":"0161-6412","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"451-9","title":"A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of Sativex, in subjects with symptoms of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1179/016164109X12590518685660","volume":"32"},{"id":"collincRandomizedControlledTrial2007","abstract":"Symptoms relating to spasticity are common in multiple sclerosis (MS) and can be difficult to treat.

This narrative review investigated the efficacy and effectiveness of NAB oromucosal spray for moderate to severe MS spasticity by examining spasticity 0–10 numerical rating scale (NRS) data from interventional and observational studies which featured a 4-week trial period as per the European Union-approved label. <b><i>Summary:</i></b> Across both study types, clinically relevant and statistically significant reductions in mean MS spasticity 0–10 NRS scores were measured soon after treatment start and were maintained in the mid- to long term in treatment responders. Initial responder rates (≥20% NRS improvement from baseline at week 4) ranged from 47.6% to 81.4%, tending lower in the randomized clinical trials setting. Clinically relevant responder rates (≥30% NRS improvement from baseline at week 12) were similar between study types (range 30–41%) except for one outlier (74% in an observational study). Two open studies reported treatment continuation for ≥18 months in approximately half of patients who initiated treatment. In most longer term studies, symptomatic improvement in MS spasticity was maintained at mean daily dosages of about 6–7 sprays/day. Safety was consistent with the known profile of NAB. <b><i>Key Messages:</i></b> Experimental and observational studies of NAB oromucosal spray recorded similar findings. About half to two-thirds of MS patients who begin treatment will perceive initial symptomatic relief of spasticity within the 4-week trial period. About 40% of patients who initiate treatment will reach the ≥30% NRS improvement threshold at 3 months, comprising the majority of patients who continue long-term treatment. A trial of therapy with NAB is useful to identify patients most likely to gain longer term improvement in spasticity symptoms and discontinue those with insufficient benefit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Conte","given":"Antonella"},{"family":"Vila Silván","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"conteReviewAvailableData2021","container-title":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","container-title-short":"Neurodegener Dis","DOI":"10.1159/000520560","ISSN":"1660-2854, 1660-2862","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.karger.com/Services/SiteLicenses","page":"55-62","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Review of Available Data for the Efficacy and Effectiveness of Nabiximols Oromucosal Spray (Sativex®) in Multiple Sclerosis Patients with Moderate to Severe Spasticity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://karger.com/NDD/article/doi/10.1159/000520560","volume":"21"},{"id":"conwayLowfrequencySTNDBSProvides2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Some people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) report poorer dynamic postural stability following high-frequency deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS), which may contribute to an increased falls risk.

To do so, we leverage a recent probabilistic extraction technique to extract pieces of the Books3 dataset from 13 open-weight LLMs. Through numerous experiments, we show that it's possible to extract substantial parts of at least some books from different LLMs. This is evidence that the LLMs have memorized the extracted text; this memorized content is copied inside the model parameters. But the results are complicated: the extent of memorization varies both by model and by book. With our specific experiments, we find that the largest LLMs don't memorize most books -- either in whole or in part.

Transection injuries that induce a nerve gap necessitate microsurgical intervention; however, even the current gold standard of repair, autologous nerve graft, frequently results in poor functional recovery. Several interventions have been developed to augment the surgical repair of peripheral nerves, and the application of functional biomaterials, local delivery of bioactive substances, electrical stimulation, and allografts are among the most promising approaches to enhance innate healing across a nerve gap. Biocompatible polymers with optimized degradation rates, topographic features, and other functions provided by their composition have been incorporated into novel nerve conduits (NCs). Many of these allow for the delivery of drugs, neurotrophic factors, and whole cells locally to nerve repair sites, mitigating adverse effects that limit their systemic use. The electrical stimulation of repaired nerves in the perioperative period has shown benefits to healing and recovery in human trials, and novel biomaterials to enhance these effects show promise in preclinical models. The use of acellular nerve allografts (ANAs) circumvents the morbidity of donor nerve harvest necessitated by the use of autografts, and improvements in tissue-processing techniques may allow for more readily available and cost-effective options. Each of these interventions aid in neural regeneration after repair when applied independently, and their differing forms, benefits, and methods of application present ample opportunity for synergistic effects when applied in combination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Crabtree","given":"Jordan R."},{"family":"Mulenga","given":"Chilando M."},{"family":"Tran","given":"Khoa"},{"family":"Feinberg","given":"Konstantin"},{"family":"Santerre","given":"J.

We previously discovered that a formin protein, Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 2 (Daam2), suppresses OL differentiation through Wnt signaling; however, its role in cytoskeletal control remains unknown. To investigate this, we used OL-specific Daam2 conditional knockout (Daam2 cKO) mice of either sex and found myelin decompaction during an active period of myelination in postnatal development and motor coordination deficits in adulthood. Using primary OL cultures, we found Daam2-depleted OLs showed morphologic dysregulation during differentiation, suggesting that Daam2 regulates the OL cytoskeleton.\n              In vivo\n              screening identified the actin regulators Rac1 and Gelsolin as possible effectors in Daam2-deficient OL cytoskeletal regulation. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function (LOF) experiments in primary OLs, we found that Rac1 and Gelsolin operate downstream of Daam2 in OL differentiation, with Gelsolin and Daam2 promoting and inhibiting membrane spreading during late differentiation, respectively.\n              In vivo\n              experiments using Daam2 cKO mice revealed increased protein levels of Gelsolin in the developing white matter with no change in RNA levels, suggesting that Daam2 acts in a posttranslational manner to suppress Gelsolin levels.\n              In vitro\n              biochemical studies show Daam2 induces Gelsolin ubiquitination and degradation in OLs.

Recently, we have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of a lupin protein hydrolysate (LPH) both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether LPH is capable of reducing the clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. EAE was induced in female C57BL/6N mice and they were treated intragastrically with LPH (100 mg/kg) or vehicle (control group) from day 0 (prophylactic approach) or from the onset of the disease (day 12 post-induction; therapeutic approach) and the clinical score of each mouse was recorded daily. Prophylactic treatment with LPH reduced the clinical score of the mice compared to the control group, as well as the maximum and cumulative scores, without changing the day of onset of the symptoms while the therapeutic intervention did not significantly improve the severity of the disease. For the first time, we demonstrated that prophylactic administration of LPH reduces the severity of MS, suggesting a potential nutraceutical or new functional foods in neuroinflammation.

Since MS pathology involves neuroinflammation, cellular oxidation and mitochondrial alterations, the objective of the study was to assess the impact of a nutritional intervention with coconut oil and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on gait and balance. In order to do this, 51 patients with MS were enrolled and randomly distributed into an intervention group and a control group, which received either a daily dose of 800 mg of EGCG and 60 ml of coconut oil, or a placebo, all during a period of 4 months and which followed a Mediterranean isocaloric diet. Initial and final assessments consisted of the evaluation of quantitative balance (Berg scale), perceived balance (ABC scale), gait speed (10MWT) and resistance (2MWT). Besides, muscle strength was measured using a dynamometer and levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were measured in serum samples. In the intervention group, there was a significant improvement in the gait speed, quantitative balance and muscle strength of the right quadriceps; an improvement in gait resistance was observed in both groups. There were also significant and positive correlations between balance and gait scales. In conclusion, the administration of EGCG and coconut oil seems to improve gait speed and balance in MS patients, although the latter was not perceived by them. Furthermore, these variables appear to be related and contribute to functionality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Cuerda-Ballester","given":"María"},{"family":"Proaño","given":"Belén"},{"family":"Alarcón-Jimenez","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"De Bernardo","given":"Nieves"},{"family":"Villaron-Casales","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Lajara Romance","given":"José María"},{"family":"De La Rubia Ortí","given":"Jose Enrique"}],"citation-key":"cuerda-ballesterImprovementsGaitBalance2023","container-title":"Food & Function","container-title-short":"Food Funct.","DOI":"10.1039/D2FO02207A","ISSN":"2042-6496, 2042-650X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"1062-1071","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Improvements in gait and balance in patients with multiple sclerosis after treatment with coconut oil and epigallocatechin gallate.

Together with antigen-specific T cells, myeloid cells are main effector cells in CNS autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, but the relative contributions of blood-derived monocytes and the tissue resident macrophages to pathology and repair is incompletely understood. Through the study of oxidized mannan-conjugated myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (OM-MOG), we show that peripheral maturation of Ly6C\n              hi\n              CCR2\n              +\n              monocytes to Ly6C\n              hi\n              MHCII\n              +\n              PD-L1\n              +\n              cells is sufficient to reverse spinal cord inflammation and demyelination in MOG-induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

Legal formalism holds that judges apply legal reasons to the facts of a case in a rational, mechanical, and deliberative manner. In contrast, legal realists argue that the rational application of legal reasons does not sufficiently explain the decisions of judges and that psychological, political, and social factors influence judicial rulings. We test the common caricature of realism that justice is “what the judge ate for breakfast” in sequential parole decisions made by experienced judges. We record the judges’ two daily food breaks, which result in segmenting the deliberations of the day into three distinct “decision sessions.” We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65% after a break. Our findings suggest that judicial rulings can be swayed by extraneous variables that should have no bearing on legal decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Danziger","given":"Shai"},{"family":"Levav","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Avnaim-Pesso","given":"Liora"}],"citation-key":"danzigerExtraneousFactorsJudicial2011","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1018033108","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",4,26]]},"page":"6889-6892","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Extraneous factors in judicial decisions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1018033108","volume":"108"},{"id":"darCRL4bInhibitionAmeliorates2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            Multiple sclerosis, and its murine model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), is a neurodegenerative autoimmune disease of the CNS characterized by T cell influx and demyelination. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, therapies can alleviate symptoms but often come with side effects, necessitating the exploration of new treatments. We recently demonstrated that the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase 4b (CRL4b) aided in maintaining genome stability in proliferating T cells. In this study, we examined whether CRL4b was required for T cells to expand and drive EAE. Mice lacking Cul4b (Cullin 4b) in T cells had reduced EAE symptoms and decreased inflammation during the peak of the disease. Significantly fewer CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were found in the CNS, particularly among the CD4+ T cell population producing IL-17A, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, and TNF-α. Additionally, Cul4b-deficient CD4+ T cells cultured in vitro with their wild-type counterparts were less likely to expand and differentiate into IL-17A– or IFN-γ–producing effector cells. When wild-type CD4+ T cells were activated in vitro in the presence of the recently developed CRL4 inhibitor KH-4-43, they exhibited increased apoptosis and DNA damage. Treatment of mice with KH-4-43 following EAE induction resulted in stabilized clinical scores and significantly reduced numbers of T cells and innate immune cells in the CNS compared with control mice. Furthermore, KH-4-43 treatment resulted in elevated expression of p21 and cyclin E2 in T cells. These studies support that therapeutic inhibition of CRL4 and/or CRL4-related pathways could be used to treat autoimmune disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Dar","given":"Asif

This has inspired research into pro-regenerative therapies that utilize transplantation of exogenous NPCs or recruitment of endogenous adult NPCs for CNS regeneration and repair. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing and other “omics” have revealed that NPCs express not just traditional progenitor-related genes, but also genes involved in immune function. Here, we review how NPCs exert immunomodulatory function by regulating the biology of microglia, immune cells that are present in NPC niches and throughout the CNS. We discuss the role of transplanted and endogenous NPCs in regulating microglia fates, such as survival, proliferation, migration, phagocytosis and activation, in the developing, injured and degenerating CNS. We also provide a literature review on NPC-specific mediators that are responsible for modulating microglia biology. Our review highlights the immunomodulatory properties of NPCs and the significance of these findings in the context of designing pro-regenerative therapies for degenerating and diseased CNS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"De Almeida","given":"Monique M.

Nowadays, a variety of new drugs are being developed to prevent excessive inflammation and halt neurodegeneration. Among these are the inhibitors of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Being indispensable for B cells, this enzyme became an appealing therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases. Recognizing the emerging importance of BTK in myeloid cells, we investigated the impact of upcoming BTK inhibitors on neutrophil functions. Although adaptive immunity in MS has been thoroughly studied, unanswered questions about the pathogenesis can be addressed by studying the effects of candidate MS drugs on innate immune cells such as neutrophils, previously overlooked in MS. In this study, we used 3 BTK inhibitors (evobrutinib, fenebrutinib, and tolebrutinib), and found that they reduce neutrophil activation by the bacterial peptide fMLF and the chemokine interleukin-8/CXCL8. Furthermore, they diminished the production of reactive oxygen species and release of neutrophil extracellular traps. Additionally, the production of CXCL8 and interleukin-1β in response to inflammatory stimuli was decreased. Inhibitory effects of the drugs on neutrophil activation were not related to toxicity. Instead, BTK inhibitors prolonged neutrophil survival in an inflammatory environment. Finally, treatment with BTK inhibitors decreased neutrophil migration toward CXCL8 in a Boyden chamber assay but not in a transendothelial setup. Also, in vivo CXCL1-induced migration was unaffected by BTK inhibitors. Collectively, this study provides novel insights into the impact of BTK inhibitors on neutrophil functions, thereby holding important implications for autoimmune or hematological diseases in which BTK is crucial.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"De Bondt","given":"Mirre"},{"family":"Renders","given":"Janne"},{"family":"Petit De Prado","given":"Paloma"},{"family":"Berghmans","given":"Nele"},{"family":"Pörtner","given":"Noëmie"},{"family":"Vanbrabant","given":"Lotte"},{"family":"De Oliveira","given":"Vívian Louise Soares"},{"family":"Duran","given":"Gayel"},{"family":"Baeten","given":"Paulien"},{"family":"Broux","given":"Bieke"},{"family":"Gouwy","given":"Mieke"},{"family":"Matthys","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Hellings","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Struyf","given":"Sofie"}],"citation-key":"debondtEffectNeutrophilMigration2024","container-title":"Journal of Leukocyte Biology","DOI":"10.1093/jleuko/qiae160","ISSN":"1938-3673","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,8]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"qiae160","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect on neutrophil migration and antimicrobial functions by the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors tolebrutinib, evobrutinib, and fenebrutinib","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jleukbio/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jleuko/qiae160/7709367"},{"id":"deepseek-aiDeepSeekR1IncentivizingReasoning2025","abstract":"We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.

Secondary outcome measures include change in neurological disability (Expanded Disability Status Score), information processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) and hand function (9-Hole Peg test). Annual brain MRI will be performed to assess evolution in brain volumetry and diffusion metrics. As patients may not progress in all domains, a composite outcome, the Overall Disability Response Score will be additionally evaluated as an exploratory outcome.

In our study conducted with Boston Consulting Group, a global management consulting firm, we examine the performance implications of AI on realistic, complex, and knowledge-intensive tasks. The pre-registered experiment involved 758 consultants comprising about 7% of the individual contributor-level consultants at the company. After establishing a performance baseline on a similar task, subjects were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: no AI access, GPT-4 AI access, or GPT-4 AI access with a prompt engineering overview. We suggest that the capabilities of AI create a “jagged technological frontier” where some tasks are easily done by AI, while others, though seemingly similar in difficulty level, are outside the current capability of AI. For each one of a set of 18 realistic consulting tasks within the frontier of AI capabilities, consultants using AI were significantly more productive (they completed 12.2% more tasks on average, and completed task  25.1% more quickly), and produced significantly higher quality results (more than 40% higher quality compared to a control group). Consultants across the skills distribution benefited significantly from having AI augmentation, with those below the average performance threshold increasing by 43% and those above increasing by 17% compared to their own scores. For a task selected to be outside the frontier, however, consultants using AI were 19 percentage points less likely to produce correct solutions compared to those without AI. Further, our analysis shows the emergence of two distinctive patterns of successful AI use by humans along a spectrum of human-AI integration. One set of consultants acted as “Centaurs,” like the mythical halfhorse/half-human creature, dividing and delegating their solution-creation activities to the AI or to themselves. Another set of consultants acted more like “Cyborgs,” completely integrating their task flow with the AI and continually interacting with the technology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Dell'Acqua","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"McFowland III","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Mollick","given":"Ethan R."},{"family":"Lifshitz-Assaf","given":"Hila"},{"family":"Kellogg","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Rajendran","given":"Saran"},{"family":"Krayer","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Candelon","given":"François"},{"family":"Lakhani","given":"Karim R."}],"citation-key":"dellacquaNavigatingJaggedTechnological2023","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.4573321","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,15]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier: Field Experimental Evidence of the Effects of AI on Knowledge Worker Productivity and Quality","title-short":"Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4573321"},{"id":"demaImmunosenescenceMultipleSclerosis2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Dema","given":"María"},{"family":"Eixarch","given":"Herena"},{"family":"Villar","given":"Luisa M."},{"family":"Montalban","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Espejo","given":"Carmen"}],"citation-key":"demaImmunosenescenceMultipleSclerosis2021","container-title":"Autoimmunity Reviews","container-title-short":"Autoimmunity Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.autrev.2021.102893","ISSN":"15689972","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"en","page":"102893","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Immunosenescence in multiple sclerosis: the identification of new therapeutic targets","title-short":"Immunosenescence in multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S156899722100166X","volume":"20"},{"id":"demmingsRebuildingNervousSystem2025","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Neuron–glia interactions are fundamental to the development and function of the nervous system. During development, glia, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, influence neuronal differentiation and migration, synapse formation and refinement, and myelination. In the mature brain, glia are crucial for maintaining neural homeostasis, modulating synaptic activity, and supporting metabolic functions. Neurons, inherently vulnerable to various stressors, rely on glia for protection and repair. However, glia, in their reactive state, can also promote neuronal damage, which contributes to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Understanding the dual role of glia—as both protectors and potential aggressors—sheds light on their complex contributions to disease etiology and pathology. By appropriately modulating glial activity, it may be possible to mitigate neurodegeneration and restore neuronal function. In this review, which originated from the International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN) Advanced School in 2019 held in Montreal, Canada, we first describe the critical importance of glia in the development and maintenance of a healthy nervous system as well as their contributions to neuronal damage and neurological disorders. We then discuss potential strategies to modulate glial activity during disease to protect and promote a properly functioning nervous system. We propose that targeting glial cells presents a promising therapeutic avenue for rebuilding the nervous system.\n              \n                \n                  image","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Demmings","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Da Silva Chagas","given":"Luana"},{"family":"Traetta","given":"Marianela E."},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"Rui S."},{"family":"Acutain","given":"Maria Florencia"},{"family":"Barykin","given":"Evgeny"},{"family":"Datusalia","given":"Ashok Kumar"},{"family":"German‐Castelan","given":"Liliana"},{"family":"Mattera","given":"Vanesa S."},{"family":"Mazengenya","given":"Pedzisai"},{"family":"Skoug","given":"Cecilia"},{"family":"Umemori","given":"Hisashi"}],"citation-key":"demmingsRebuildingNervousSystem2025","container-title":"Journal of Neurochemistry","container-title-short":"Journal of Neurochemistry","DOI":"10.1111/jnc.16258","ISSN":"0022-3042, 1471-4159","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1]]},"language":"en","page":"e16258","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"(Re)building the nervous system: A review of neuron–glia interactions from development to disease","title-short":"(Re)building the nervous system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jnc.16258","volume":"169"},{"id":"denarosoDeletionVoltagegatedCalcium2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              The experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis was used in combination with a Cav1.2 conditional knock-out mouse (Cav1.2\n              KO\n              ) to study the role of astrocytic voltage-gated Ca\n              ++\n              channels in autoimmune CNS inflammation and demyelination.

While previous studies have investigated various aspects of AD, the specific lipid changes in key brain regions remain inadequately defined.Objective To quantitatively evaluate lipid levels within the amygdala and frontal cortex regions of interest using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in a cohort of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of individuals with confirmed AD compared to healthy controls.Methods Thirty MRI examinations from individuals with confirmed AD were compared to 30 normal controls. MRS data were acquired using a 1.5T scanner, focusing on lipid peaks within specific frequency ranges. A voxel-based MRS technique was employed to assess lipid concentrations, focusing on spectral data in defined frequency ranges associated with lipid presence. Lipid concentrations were quantified, and statistical comparisons were performed between groups using the t-test.Results MRS analysis revealed distinct lipid peaks in both the amygdala and frontal cortex of AD patients, with frequencies indicating elevated lipid concentrations compared to controls. In the amygdala, increased lipid concentrations were observed in the 2.5-3.5 ppm range, suggesting alterations in lipid composition. The similar findings were observed in the frontal cortex, with AD patients showing significantly elevated lipid peaks within the 3.0-4.5 ppm range.Conclusion Our results underscore the potential of MRS to identify lipid alterations in AD, suggesting that lipid profiles in the amygdala and frontal cortex could serve as biomarkers for disease progression and provide understanding into neurodegenerative mechanisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:According to Article 1, Sole Paragraph, of Resolution No. 510, 2016, the following shall not be registered or evaluated by the Research Ethics Committee, National Research Ethics Commission System, Brazil, Research utilizing databases in which the information is aggregated, with no possibility of individual identification.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Healthy maturation of the myelinated white matter requires appropriate neural activity and coordinated delivery of key nutritional building blocks, including short and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, phospholipids, and sphingolipids. While many of these nutrients are amply supplied by breastmilk, they are often provided in only limited quantities in infant formula milk. Milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) is a rich source of phospholipids, including sphingomyelin and has been associated with improved cognitive development in infants and children when added to infant formula. To determine if added bovine MFGM is also associated with improved myelination, this study used myelin-sensitive MRI to compare myelination trends in healthy infants and toddlers who received the same infant formula with and without added bovine MFGM in two temporal cohorts: Without Added MFGM between 2009 and 2016; and With Added MFGM between 2018–2020. We also used the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) to compare verbal, non-verbal, and overall cognitive abilities. Matched for important demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, we found that children who received infant formula with added MFGM showed improved myelination in motor-related areas (motor cortices, internal capsule, and cerebellum) and improved MSEL nonverbal and fine motor scores. No significant differences in verbal or overall cognitive ability scores were noted. These results support the importance of phospholipids, sphingolipids, and sphingomyelin in promoting brain myelination and cognitive development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Deoni","given":"Sean

Currently, their therapeutic potential is harnessed in autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Autologous HSCT is helpful in immune-mediated neurological diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis. However, clinical benefits derive more from the immunosuppressive conditioning regimen than the interaction between stem cells and the nervous system. Mainly used for hematologic malignancies, allogeneic HSCT explores the therapeutic potential of donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells. In the neurological setting, it has proven to be most valuable in Inborn Errors of Metabolism, a large spectrum of multisystem disorders characterized by congenital deficiencies in enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. Inborn Errors of Metabolism such as X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy present with brain accumulation of enzymatic substrates that result in progressive inflammatory demyelination. Allogeneic HSCT can halt ongoing inflammatory neural destruction by replacing hematopoietic-originated microglia with donor-derived myeloid precursors. Microglia, the only neural cells successfully transplanted thus far, are the most valuable source of central nervous system metabolic correction and play a significant role in the crosstalk between the brain and hematopoietic stem cells. After transplantation, engrafted donor-derived myeloid cells modulate the neural microenvironment by recapitulating microglial functions and enhancing repair mechanisms such as remyelination. In some disorders, additional benefits result from the donor hematopoietic stem cell secretome that cross-corrects neighboring neural cells\n              via\n              mannose-6-phosphatase paracrine pathways. The limitations of allogeneic HSCT in this setting relate to the slow turnover of microglia and complications such as graft-vs.-host disease. These restraints have accelerated the development of hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, where autologous hematopoietic stem cells are collected, manipulated\n              ex vivo\n              to overexpress the missing enzyme, and infused back into the patient. With this cellular drug vehicle strategy, the brain is populated by improved cells and exposed to supraphysiological levels of the flawed protein, resulting in metabolic correction. This review focuses on the mechanisms of brain repair resulting from HSCT and gene therapy in Inborn Errors of Metabolism. A brief mention will also be made on immune-mediated nervous system diseases that are treated with this approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"De Vasconcelos","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Lacerda","given":"João F."}],"citation-key":"devasconcelosHematopoieticStemCell2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

Why endogenous repair mechanisms frequently fail in these disorders is poorly understood. However, there is now evidence indicating that this is related to an overly inflammatory microenvironment combined with the intrinsic inability of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to differentiate into mature myelinating cells. Previously, we found that phloretin, a flavonoid abundantly present in apples and strawberries, reduces neuroinflammation by driving macrophages toward an antiinflammatory phenotype. Here, we show that phloretin also markedly stimulates remyelination in ex vivo and in vivo animal models. Improved remyelination was attributed to a direct impact of phloretin on OPC maturation and occurred independently from alterations in microglia function and inflammation. We found, mechanistically, that phloretin acts as a direct ligand for the fatty acid sensing nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, thereby promoting the maturation of OPCs. Together, our findings indicate that phloretin has proregenerative properties in central nervous system disorders, with potentially broad implications for the development of therapeutic strategies and dietary interventions aimed at promoting remyelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Dierckx","given":"Tess"},{"family":"Vanherle","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Haidar","given":"Mansour"},{"family":"Grajchen","given":"Elien"},{"family":"Mingneau","given":"Fleur"},{"family":"Gervois","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Wolfs","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Bylemans","given":"Dany"},{"family":"Voet","given":"Arnout"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Tien"},{"family":"Hamad","given":"Ibrahim"},{"family":"Kleinewietfeld","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Bogie","given":"Jeroen F.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 exerts its effects by activating a membrane receptor identified in many tissues, including different brain regions. Glucagon-like peptide 1 activates several signaling pathways related to neuroprotection, like the support of cell growth/survival, enhancement promotion of synapse formation, autophagy, and inhibition of the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, microglial activation, and apoptosis during neural morphogenesis. The glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, maintain metabolic homeostasis and defense against pathogens in the central nervous system. After brain insult, microglia are the first cells to respond, followed by reactive astrocytosis. These activated cells produce proinflammatory mediators like cytokines or chemokines to react to the insult. Furthermore, under these circumstances, microglia can become chronically inflammatory by losing their homeostatic molecular signature and, consequently, their functions during many diseases. Several processes promote the development of neurological disorders and influence their pathological evolution: like the formation of protein aggregates, the accumulation of abnormally modified cellular constituents, the formation and release by injured neurons or synapses of molecules that can dampen neural function, and, of critical importance, the dysregulation of inflammatory control mechanisms. The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist emerges as a critical tool in treating brain-related inflammatory pathologies, restoring brain cell homeostasis under inflammatory conditions, modulating microglia activity, and decreasing the inflammatory response. This review summarizes recent advances linked to the anti-inflammatory properties of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor activation in the brain related to multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, or chronic migraine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Diz-Chaves","given":"Yolanda"},{"family":"Maastor","given":"Zainab"},{"family":"Spuch","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Lamas","given":"José Antonio"},{"family":"González-Matías","given":"Lucas C."},{"family":"Mallo","given":"Federico"}],"citation-key":"diz-chavesGlucagonlikePeptide12024","container-title":"Neural Regeneration Research","DOI":"10.4103/1673-5374.389626","ISSN":"1673-5374, 1876-7958","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8]]},"language":"en","page":"1671-1677","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor activation: anti-inflammatory effects in the brain","title-short":"Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor activation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/10.4103/1673-5374.389626","volume":"19"},{"id":"djumaevaSuccessfulApplicationInformation2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Djumaeva","given":"Naylya"}],"citation-key":"djumaevaSuccessfulApplicationInformation2024","container-title":"Journal of Medical Case Reports","container-title-short":"J Med Case Reports","DOI":"10.1186/s13256-024-04909-1","ISSN":"1752-1947","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,25]]},"language":"en","page":"561","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A successful application of information technologies in the treatment of multiple sclerosis: a case report","title-short":"A successful application of information technologies in the treatment of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-024-04909-1","volume":"18"},{"id":"donatoTransformacoesNaPublicacao2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Donato","given":"Helena"}],"citation-key":"donatoTransformacoesNaPublicacao2024","container-title":"Lusiadas Scientific Journal","DOI":"10.48687/lsj.252","ISSN":"2975-8254","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,30]]},"language":"pt","license":"Copyright (c) 2024 Lusiadas Scientific Journal","number":"4","page":"123-125","source":"lusiadasscientificjournal.pt","title":"Transformações na Publicação Científica Impulsionadas pela Inteligência Artificial","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://lusiadasscientificjournal.pt/index.php/lsj/article/view/252","volume":"5"},{"id":"dongIdentificationPotentialFunctional2023","abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory neurologic disease characterized by the demyelinating injury of the central nervous system (CNS).

The aim of this work is to characterise white matter injury caused by brain tumours, unrelated to treatment effects, and explore heterogeneity in these white matter abnormalities between individual patients.Methods We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion Diffusion Imaging (NODDI) to assess white matter injury in 8 posterior fossa tumour patients. A novel one-against-many approach was used by comparing an individual patient to 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls to assess variability in white matter abnormalities between the posterior fossa tumour patients. White matter was analysed at presentation (prior to treatment), post-surgery (24-72 hours after surgery), and at follow-up (3-18 months after surgery).Results We demonstrate white matter abnormalities in 5 posterior fossa tumour patients before treatment, likely related to tumour-induced hydrocephalus, which persisted after treatment. White matter changes were complex and patient-specific, and group-based comparisons with control sub-jects may fail to detect these individual abnormalities.Conclusions Identifying pre-treatment white matter injury in posterior fossa tumour patients highlights the importance of personalised assessment of brain microstructure, which should be considered in minimising neurocognitive deficits to improve patient quality of life.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementEDM is funded by the UCL EPSRC CDT i4health (grant reference EP/ S021930/1), and EDM and DRH are funded by the NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR-INF-2647).

This cascade of events results in demyelination, which triggers neuronal damage and death. The molecular signals in neurons responsible for this damage are not yet fully characterized. In MS, retinal ganglion cell neurons (RGCs) of the central nervous system (CNS) undergo axonal injury and cell death. This phenomenon is mirrored in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. To understand the molecular landscape, we isolated RGCs from mice subjected to the EAE protocol. RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing analyses were performed. Pathway analysis of the RNA-sequencing data revealed that RGCs displayed a molecular signature, similar to aged neurons, showcasing features of senescence. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of neurons from human MS patients revealed a comparable senescence-like phenotype., which was supported by immunostaining RGCs in EAE mice. These changes include alterations to the nuclear envelope, modifications in chromatin marks, and accumulation of DNA damage. Transduction of RGCs with an\n            Oct4\n            -\n            Sox2\n            -\n            Klf4\n            transgene to convert neurons in the EAE model to a more youthful epigenetic and transcriptomic state enhanced the survival of RGCs. Collectively, this research uncovers a previously unidentified senescent-like phenotype in neurons under pathological inflammation and neurons from MS patients. The rejuvenation of this aged transcriptome improved visual acuity and neuronal survival in the EAE model supporting the idea that age rejuvenation therapies and senotherapeutic agents could offer a direct means of neuroprotection in autoimmune disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Drake","given":"Sienna S."},{"family":"Mohammadnia","given":"Abdulshakour"},{"family":"Heale","given":"Kali"},{"family":"Groh","given":"Adam M.R."},{"family":"Hua","given":"Elizabeth M.-L."},{"family":"Zaman","given":"Aliyah"},{"family":"Hintermayer","given":"Matthew A."},{"family":"Zandee","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Gosselin","given":"David"},{"family":"Stratton","given":"Jo Anne"},{"family":"Sinclair","given":"David A."},{"family":"Fournier","given":"Alyson E."}],"citation-key":"drakeCellularRejuvenationProtects2023","DOI":"10.1101/2023.09.30.560301","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,2]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Neuroscience","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cellular rejuvenation protects neurons from inflammation mediated cell death","type":"article","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2023.09.30.560301"},{"id":"drakeSenolyticTreatmentDiminishes2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Drake","given":"Sienna S."},{"family":"Zaman","given":"Aliyah"},{"family":"Gianfelice","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Hua","given":"Elizabeth M.-L."},{"family":"Heale","given":"Kali"},{"family":"Afanasiev","given":"Elia"},{"family":"Klement","given":"Wendy"},{"family":"Stratton","given":"Jo Anne"},{"family":"Prat","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Zandee","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Fournier","given":"Alyson E."}],"citation-key":"drakeSenolyticTreatmentDiminishes2024","container-title":"Journal of Neuroinflammation","container-title-short":"J Neuroinflammation","DOI":"10.1186/s12974-024-03278-2","ISSN":"1742-2094","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"283","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Senolytic treatment diminishes microglia and decreases severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-024-03278-2","volume":"21"},{"id":"dupreeLanthionineKetimineEthyl2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Dupree","given":"Jeffrey L."},{"family":"Paez","given":"Pablo M."},{"family":"Tiwari-Woodruff","given":"Seema K."},{"family":"Denton","given":"Travis T."},{"family":"Hensley","given":"Kenneth"},{"family":"Angeliu","given":"Christina G."},{"family":"Boullerne","given":"Anne I."},{"family":"Kalinin","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Egge","given":"Sophia"},{"family":"Cheli","given":"Veronica T."},{"family":"Denaroso","given":"Giancarlo"},{"family":"Atkinson","given":"Kelley C."},{"family":"Feri","given":"Micah"},{"family":"Feinstein","given":"Douglas L."}],"citation-key":"dupreeLanthionineKetimineEthyl2022","container-title":"ASN Neuro","container-title-short":"ASN Neuro","DOI":"10.1177/17590914221112352","ISSN":"1759-0914","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","page":"17590914221112352","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Lanthionine Ketimine Ethyl Ester Accelerates Remyelination in a Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1177/17590914221112352","volume":"14"},{"id":"duttaBreakingBubbleCase2025","abstract":"The echo chamber effect on social media platforms, particularly Instagram, significantly influences users’ perception by creating environments where similar views are repeatedly reinforced.

The study examines psychological and social factors, including selective exposure theory, social identity, and emotional resonance, which intensify the echo chamber effect on a highly visual platform like Instagram. Findings suggest that this phenomenon can fragment social networks, create polarised communities, and contribute to the spread of misinformation.

Over the last decades, the repertoire substantially increased because of the conceptual progress that not only T cells but also B cells play an important pathogenic role in MS, fostered by the empirical success of B cell–depleting antibodies against the surface molecule CD20. Notwithstanding this advance, a continuous absence of B cells may harbor safety risks, such as a decline in the endogenous production of immunoglobulins. Accordingly, novel B cell–directed MS therapies are in development, such as inhibitors targeting Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK).\n            \n            \n              Observations\n              BTK is centrally involved in the B cell receptor–mediated activation of B cells, one key requirement in the development of autoreactive B cells, but also in the activation of myeloid cells, such as macrophages and microglia. Various compounds in development differ in their binding mode, selectivity and specificity, relative inhibitory concentration, and potential to enter the central nervous system. The latter may be important in assessing whether BTK inhibition is a promising strategy to control inflammatory circuits within the brain, the key process that is assumed to drive MS progression. Accordingly, clinical trials using BTK inhibitors are currently conducted in patients with relapsing-remitting MS as well as progressive MS, so far generating encouraging data regarding efficacy and safety.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions and Relevance\n              While the novel approach of targeting BTK is highly promising, several questions remain unanswered, such as the long-term effects of using BTK inhibitors in the treatment of inflammatory CNS disease. Potential changes in circulating antibody levels should be evaluated and compared with B cell depletion. Also important is the potential of BTK inhibitors to enter the CNS, which depends on the given compound. Remaining questions involve where BTK inhibitors fit in the landscape of MS therapeutics. A comparative analysis of their distinct properties is necessary to identify which inhibitors may be used in relapsing vs progressive forms of MS as well as to clarify which agent may be most suitable for sequential use after anti-CD20 treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Dybowski","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Torke","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Weber","given":"Martin S."}],"citation-key":"dybowskiTargetingCellsMicroglia2023","container-title":"JAMA Neurology","container-title-short":"JAMA Neurol","DOI":"10.1001/jamaneurol.2022.5332","ISSN":"2168-6149","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"404","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Targeting B Cells and Microglia in Multiple Sclerosis With Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors: A Review","title-short":"Targeting B Cells and Microglia in Multiple Sclerosis With Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2801597","volume":"80"},{"id":"dykukhaiEffectsSativexCognitive2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a common manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: To assess by systematic review and meta-analysis available evidence regarding the impact of nabiximols oromucosal spray on cognition in patients with MS. METHODS: A systematic literature search of clinical studies (all types, any comparator) that measured cognitive function in patients with MS spasticity treated with nabiximols. Meta-analysis for cognitive endpoints was not possible due to heterogenous measurement instruments and outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed for adverse events (AEs) of special interest (cognition disorders) reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of nabiximols versus placebo in patients with MS (with or without spasticity). Certainty of evidence and risk of bias were assessed. RESULTS: Seven clinical studies (three RCTs) directly assessing cognitive function were included in the qualitative analysis. There was no consistent evidence to suggest that nabiximols causes cognitive impairment as assessed by a range of specific psychometric instruments across cognitive domains. Thirteen double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs (nabiximols, n = 964; placebo, n = 904) were included in the meta-analysis of cognitive AEs. Most cognitive AEs (30 of 32 events, 93.8%) reported with nabiximols in MS patients occurred with not in-label use, i.e., dosage >12 sprays per day and/or not administered primarily for treatment of spasticity. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the review, we can conclude that no detrimental effects of nabiximols on cognitive function were observed in patients with MS spasticity during up to 12 months follow-up and that cognitive AEs were rare and occurred only when nabiximols was not used according to its approved label.","author":[{"literal":"Dykukha I"},{"literal":"Essner U"},{"literal":"Schreiber H"},{"literal":"Raithel L M"},{"literal":"Penner I K"}],"citation-key":"dykukhaiEffectsSativexCognitive2022","container-title":"Mult Scler Relat Disord","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2022.104173","ISSN":"2211-0348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"104173","title":"Effects of Sativex(Ⓡ) on cognitive function in patients with multiple sclerosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2022.104173","volume":"68"},{"id":"EarlyReductionMRI2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"citation-key":"EarlyReductionMRI2022","container-title":"Neurology Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation","container-title-short":"Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm","DOI":"10.1212/NXI.0000000000200061","ISSN":"2332-7812","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11]]},"language":"en","page":"e200061","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Early Reduction of MRI Activity During 6 Months of Cladribine Tablet Treatment for Highly Active Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis: MAGNIFY-MS","title-short":"Early Reduction of MRI Activity During 6 Months of Cladribine Tablet Treatment for Highly Active Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/NXI.0000000000200061","volume":"9"},{"id":"EchoChambersFilter2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,3]]},"citation-key":"EchoChambersFilter2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,19]]},"language":"en","title":"Echo chambers, filter bubbles, and polarisation: a literature review | Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism","title-short":"Echo chambers, filter bubbles, and polarisation","type":"webpage","URL":"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/echo-chambers-filter-bubbles-and-polarisation-literature-review"},{"id":"edoTherapeuticEffectIL212022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Edo","given":"Ángel"},{"family":"Calvo-Barreiro","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Eixarch","given":"Herena"},{"family":"Bosch","given":"Assumpció"},{"family":"Chillón","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Espejo","given":"Carmen"}],"citation-key":"edoTherapeuticEffectIL212022","container-title":"Neurotherapeutics","container-title-short":"Neurotherapeutics","DOI":"10.1007/s13311-022-01279-8","ISSN":"18787479","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1617-1633","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Therapeutic Effect of IL-21 Blockage by Gene Therapy in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1878747923001927","volume":"19"},{"id":"EdwardBernays2019","citation-key":"EdwardBernays2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,3]]},"title":"Edward bernays","type":"document","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Bernays&oldid=909190529"},{"id":"eftekhariBlockadeProteinaseActivatedReceptor2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Eftekhari","given":"Rahil"},{"family":"Ewanchuk","given":"Benjamin W."},{"family":"Rawji","given":"Khalil S."},{"family":"Yates","given":"Robin M."},{"family":"Noorbakhsh","given":"Farshid"},{"family":"Kuipers","given":"Hedwich F."},{"family":"Hollenberg","given":"Morley D."}],"citation-key":"eftekhariBlockadeProteinaseActivatedReceptor2024","container-title":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","container-title-short":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","DOI":"10.1124/jpet.123.001685","ISSN":"00223565","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","page":"12-22","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Blockade of Proteinase-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) Attenuates Neuroinflammation in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022356524171339","volume":"388"},{"id":"ehlingSuccessfulLongtermManagement2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background and purpose\n              Successful long‐term treatment of spasticity in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is challenging.

Here, we leverage a multi-level genetic discovery platform integrating population-level proteomics with functional genomic analyses based on human coronary artery tissue to reveal determinants of coronary disease susceptibility. Using aptamer-based proteomics (≈7,000 aptamers) across ≈3,000 individuals, we first identified the circulating proteome of prevalent and incident coronary artery calcium (CAC)—a sensitive marker of subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD)—with causal implication in calcified plaque formation or disease phenotypes via parallel genetic approaches (Mendelian randomization, MR) and proteome-wide association (PWAS). Identified proteins specified pathways of extracellular matrix remodeling, immune cell function, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. To resolve findings at a coronary tissue level, we performed the largest to date coronary artery-specific transcriptome-wide association study for CAC (TWAS; based on RNA-seq from 268 human coronary arteries) in &gt;35,000 individuals, demonstrating enrichment of targets from the circulating proteome with supportive evidence by traditional MR approaches (NOTCH3, SPINK2, S100A12, RPP25, OAF, HS6ST3, TNFSF12, GPC6), several implicated in CVD-adjacent biological mechanisms. Phenome-wide association and single cell transcriptomics in human coronary arteries across atherosclerosis implicated targets in tissue-specific disease mechanisms. Finally, using coronary artery-specific functional genomic annotations of chromatin structure, conformation, and accessibility, we identified trans regulation of two of these genes (GPC6, RPP25) by CAC GWAS-significant SNPs, resolving targets for previously “orphan” genome-wide significant loci. These multi-level findings furnish a resource for pathobiology of CAC, atherosclerosis, and establish an adaptable framework applicable to all organ systems to parse precision targets for prevention, surveillance, and therapy of cardiovascular disease.Competing Interest StatementDr. Perry is a co-inventor on proteomic signatures of fitness, liver, and respiratory disease.

Central Nervous System (CNS) intrafusal settings have an impact on spasticity level. Mechanoreceptors of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) communicate monosynaptically with the central nervous system (CNS). This case series assesses feasibility of multimodal treatment of individuals with MS using a direct current electrical stimulation (DC) to influence mechanoreceptors.\n            \n            \n              Case Description and Intervention\n              Seven MS diagnosed participants with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) = 6.0–8.0 completed 18 visits over 6 weeks of using DC combined with neuromuscular reeducation. Design included pre-, post- outcome measures of EDSS, 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), Range of Motion (ROM), Manual Muscle Testing (MMT), Modified Ashworth Test (MAT), Timed 25-Foot walk (T25WT), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29).\n            \n            \n              Outcome\n              125 out of a possible 126 visits were completed, demonstrating a high level of tolerance.

However, despite their increasing prevalence, little progress has been made in successfully treating these diseases. Research has recently focused on neurotrophic factors (NTFs) as potential regenerative therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we discuss the current state of knowledge, challenges, and future perspectives of NTFs with a direct regenerative effect in chronic inflammatory and degenerative disorders. Various systems for delivery of NTFs, such as stem and immune cells, viral vectors, and biomaterials, have been applied to deliver exogenous NTFs to the central nervous system, with promising results. The challenges that currently need to be overcome include the amount of NTFs delivered, the invasiveness of the delivery route, the blood–brain barrier permeability, and the occurrence of side effects. Nevertheless, it is important to continue research and develop standards for clinical applications. In addition to the use of single NTFs, the complexity of chronic inflammatory and degenerative diseases may require combination therapies targeting multiple pathways or other possibilities using smaller molecules, such as NTF mimetics, for effective treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"El Ouaamari","given":"Yousra"},{"family":"Van Den Bos","given":"Jasper"},{"family":"Willekens","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Cools","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Wens","given":"Inez"}],"citation-key":"elouaamariNeurotrophicFactorsRegenerative2023","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms24043866","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,15]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"3866","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neurotrophic Factors as Regenerative Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Status, Challenges and Future Perspectives","title-short":"Neurotrophic Factors as Regenerative Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/4/3866","volume":"24"},{"id":"elseFightFakepaperFactories2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Else","given":"Holly"},{"family":"Van Noorden","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"elseFightFakepaperFactories2021","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/d41586-021-00733-5","ISSN":"0028-0836, 1476-4687","issue":"7851","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,25]]},"language":"en","page":"516-519","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The fight against fake-paper factories that churn out sham science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5","volume":"591"},{"id":"EmailMarketingBenchmarks","abstract":"Understanding email marketing metrics & benchmarks can help you optimize campaigns and understand where you stand relative to industry standards.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,5]]},"citation-key":"EmailMarketingBenchmarks","container-title":"Salesforce","language":"en","title":"Email Marketing Benchmarks (2024)","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.salesforce.com/marketing/email/benchmarks/"},{"id":"EmailMarketingBenchmarks2025","abstract":"Email marketing benchmarks by region, industry, and deliverability.

While most of the current treatment strategies focus on immune cell regulation, except for the drug siponimod, there is no therapeutic intervention that primarily aims at neuroprotection and remyelination. Recently, nimodipine showed a beneficial and remyelinating effect in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of MS. Nimodipine also positively affected astrocytes, neurons, and mature oligodendrocytes. Here we investigated the effects of nimodipine, an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist, on the expression profile of myelin genes and proteins in the oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) line Oli-Neu and in primary OPCs. Our data indicate that nimodipine does not have any effect on myelin-related gene and protein expression. Furthermore, nimodipine treatment did not result in any morphological changes in these cells. However, RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses identified potential micro (mi)RNA that could support myelination after nimodipine treatment compared to a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control. Additionally, we treated zebrafish with nimodipine and observed a significant increase in the number of mature oligodendrocytes (* p≤ 0.05). Taken together, nimodipine seems to have different positive effects on OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Enders","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Weier","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Chunder","given":"Rittika"},{"family":"An","given":"Young"},{"family":"Bremm","given":"Franziska"},{"family":"Feigenspan","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Buettner","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Ekici","given":"Arif Bülent"},{"family":"Mingardo","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Odermatt","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Kuerten","given":"Stefanie"}],"citation-key":"endersImpactVoltageGatedCalcium2023","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms24043716","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,13]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"3716","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Impact of the Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel Antagonist Nimodipine on the Development of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/4/3716","volume":"24"},{"id":"endoOralAdministrationProcyanidin2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Endo","given":"Katsunori"},{"family":"Sawa","given":"Toko"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Yuna"},{"family":"Saiki","given":"Takeru"},{"family":"Haga","given":"Hazuki"},{"family":"Rizeq","given":"Lana"},{"family":"Aso","given":"Haruka"},{"family":"Isono","given":"Momoka"},{"family":"Niitsuma","given":"Fumie"},{"family":"Masaki","given":"Akihiro"},{"family":"Makabe","given":"Hidefumi"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Sachi"}],"citation-key":"endoOralAdministrationProcyanidin2023","container-title":"European Journal of Pharmacology","container-title-short":"European Journal of Pharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2023.175879","ISSN":"00142999","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","page":"175879","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Oral administration of procyanidin B2 3,3\"-di-O-gallate ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis through immunosuppressive effects on CD4+ T cells by regulating glycolysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014299923003904","volume":"954"},{"id":"enrich-bengoaTRPV2KeyPlayer2022","abstract":"Transient potential receptor vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) is widely expressed through the nervous system and specifically found in neuronal subpopulations and some glial cells. TRPV2 is known to be sensitized by methionine oxidation, which results from inflammation. Here we aim to characterize the expression and regulation of TRPV2 in myelination pathologies, such as hypomyelination and demyelination. We validated the interaction between TRPV2 and its putative interactor Opalin, an oligodendrocyte marker, in mixed glial cultures under pro- and anti-inflammatory conditions. Then, we characterized TRPV2 time-course expression in experimental animal models of hypomyelination (jimpy mice) and de-/remyelination (cuprizone intoxication and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)). TRPV2 showed upregulation associated with remyelination, inflammation in cuprizone and EAE models, and downregulation in hypomyelinated jimpy mice. TRPV2 expression was altered in human samples of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Additionally, we analyzed the expression of methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA), an enzyme that reduces oxidated methionines in TRPV2, which we found increased in inflammatory conditions. These results suggest that TRPV2 may be a key player in myelination in accordance with the recapitulation hypothesis, and that it may become an interesting clinical target in the treatment of demyelination disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Enrich-Bengoa","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Manich","given":"Gemma"},{"family":"Valente","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Sanchez-Molina","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Almolda","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"Solà","given":"Carme"},{"family":"Saura","given":"Josep"},{"family":"González","given":"Berta"},{"family":"Castellano","given":"Bernardo"},{"family":"Perálvarez-Marín","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"enrich-bengoaTRPV2KeyPlayer2022","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms23073617","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,25]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"3617","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"TRPV2: A Key Player in Myelination Disorders of the Central Nervous System","title-short":"TRPV2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/7/3617","volume":"23"},{"id":"ergulmEffectivenessInterventionsTargeting2022","abstract":"Objective: This systematic review was investigating the effectiveness of interventions targeting spasticity on functional clinical outcomes patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).

This systematic review included any types of clinical trial that investigate effects of the interventions targeting spasticity on functional clinical outcomes of pwMS. Results: A total of 10 studies were included in this review. Two articles investigated the effects of pharmacological interventions; one of these used Botulinum neurotoxin A (BONT-A), and the other one used cannabis cigarettes. Eight articles examined the effects of non-pharmacological interventions; six of these used exercise therapy one of these used vibration therapy and the remaining one used cold therapy. Outcomes related to spasticity, functional status, pain and quality of life were reported. One of two articles examining pharmacological interventions reported significant improvement in spasticity and functional outcomes. Two of eight articles examining non-pharmacological interventions reported significant improvement in spasticity, functional and pain outcomes. Conclusions: There is limited evidence for the beneficial effects of interventions targeting spasticity on functional clinical outcomes in pwMS.

In this condition, the administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) controls neuroinflammation, attenuating astrogliosis and promoting the acquisition of stem cell traits by astrocytes. To contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of EAE in gray matter and in the reverting effects of MSC treatment, the neocortex of EAE-affected mice was investigated by analyzing the cellular source(s) of chemokine CCL2, a molecule involved in immune cell recruitment and BBB-microvessel leakage.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The study was carried out by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and dual RNAscope IHC/in situ hybridization methods, using astrocyte, NG2-glia, macrophage/microglia, and microglia elective markers combined with CCL2.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The results showed that in EAE-affected mice, hypertrophic microglia are the primary source of CCL2, surround the cortex neurons and the damaged BBB microvessels.

This was associated with a reduced CCL2 expression and with apparently preserved/restored BBB features.

Alongside its role in B cell receptor signaling and B cell development, BTK regulates myeloid cell activation and inflammatory responses. Here we demonstrate efficacy of BTK inhibition in a model of secondary progressive autoimmune demyelination in Biozzi mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We show that late in the course of disease, EAE severity could not be reduced with a potent relapse inhibitor, FTY720 (fingolimod), indicating that disease was relapse-independent. During this same phase of disease, treatment with a BTK inhibitor reduced both EAE severity and demyelination compared to vehicle treatment. Compared to vehicle treatment, late therapeutic BTK inhibition resulted in fewer spinal cord-infiltrating myeloid cells, with lower expression of CD86, pro-IL-1β, CD206, and Iba1, and higher expression of Arg1, in both tissue-resident and infiltrating myeloid cells, suggesting a less inflammatory myeloid cell milieu. These changes were accompanied by decreased spinal cord axonal damage. We show similar efficacy with two small molecule inhibitors, including a novel, highly selective, central nervous system-penetrant BTK inhibitor, GB7208. These results suggest that through lymphoid and myeloid cell regulation, BTK inhibition reduced neurodegeneration and disease progression during secondary progressive EAE.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Evonuk","given":"Kirsten Scarlett"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Sen"},{"family":"Mattie","given":"Josh"},{"family":"Cracchiolo","given":"C.

Using large-scale multimodal data from the UK Biobank, we integrated plasma proteomics with organ imaging to map their phenotypic and genetic links, analyzing 2,923 proteins and 1,051 imaging traits across multiple organs. We uncovered 5,067 phenotypic protein-imaging associations, identifying both organ-specific and organ-shared proteomic relations, along with their enriched protein-protein interaction networks and biological pathways. By integrating external gene expression data, we observed that plasma proteins associated with the brain, liver, lung, pancreas, and spleen tended to be primarily produced in the corresponding organs, while proteins associated with the heart, body fat, and skeletal muscle were predominantly expressed in the liver. We also mapped key protein predictors of organ structures and showed the effective stratification capability of plasma protein-based prediction models. Furthermore, we identified 8,116 genetic-root putative causal links between proteins and imaging traits across multiple organs. Our study presents the most comprehensive pan-organ imaging proteomics map, bridging molecular and structural biology and offering a valuable resource to contextualize the complex roles of molecular pathways underlying plasma proteomics in organ systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementResearch reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute On Aging under Award Numbers RF1AG082938 and 1R01AG085581.

Immune cell subsets, notably T helper (Th) 17 and Th1, exert important roles in MS pathogenesis. Whereas, Treg cells modulate the disease process. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, and curcumin, a bioactive compound derived from turmeric, play immunomodulatory effects relevant to autoimmune disorders, including MS. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of calcitriol and Curcumin on Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of individuals with MS.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              PBMCs from twenty MS patients were isolated, cultured, and exposed to 0.004 μg/mL of calcitriol and 10 μg/mL of curcumin. The cells underwent treatment with singular or combined doses of these components to assess potential cumulative or synergistic immunomod-ulatory effects. Following treatment, the expression levels of genes and the cellular population of Treg, Th1 and Th17 were evaluated using Real-time PCR and flow cytometry.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Treatment with curcumin and calcitriol led to a significant reduction in the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors related to Th1 and Th17 cells, including IFN-γ, T-bet, IL-17, and RORC.

Proprioceptive deficit was found to be one of the main causes of this imbalance. The cervical enlargement has a strong proprioceptive system, with its projections to the reticular formation and the central pattern generators, helping in rhythmic pattern generation and alternate leg movements. Repetitive trans-spinal magnetic stimulation (rTSMS) is a noninvasive technique, which can trigger massive proprioceptive afferents. Therefore, it has the potential of improving proprioceptive deficits and motor control. Objective. To determine the effectiveness of repetitive cervical magnetic stimulation in improving functional ambulation of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Design. Prospective sequential clinical trial. Setting. University and academic hospital. Participants. A total of 32 participants (\n              \n                \n                  N\n                  =\n                  32\n                \n              \n              ) with RRMS. Interventions. Outpatient rehabilitation. The 32 patients received 10 sessions over two weeks of 20 Hz cervical spinal magnetic stimulation (SMS). Both groups were assessed at baseline, after 2 weeks, then one month later. Patients were enrolled as a control group at first and received Sham SMS, and then a wash out period of one month was done for all the patients, followed by a baseline assessment. Second, the same 32 patients rejoined as the active group, which received real magnetic stimulation. Both groups performed an intensive physical therapy program with the spinal magnetic stimulation. Main Outcome Measures. Extended Disability status score (EDSS), Timed up and Go test (TUG), Mini-Best test, dynamic posturography sensory organization composite score, and motor composite score. Results. Thirty-two RRMS patients with EDSS range from 1.5 to 6. They showed statistically significant difference between active and control groups in Mini-Best test score. We divided our patients according to EDSS into 3 subgroups: (a) mild: ≤2.5, (b) moderate: 3-5.5, and (c) severe: ≥6. Mild cases showed significant differences in EDSS score, TUG test, Mini-Best test, and dynamic posturography sensory composite scale. The effect size between the different patient subgroups was also measured and showed highly significant improvements in all measured parameters among our mild patients, indicating that this subgroup could be the best responders to cervical repetitive high-frequency magnetic stimulation. Moderate cases showed highly significant improvement in TUG score and Mini-Best test and significant change in EDSS score and the dynamic posturography sensory composite score. Severe cases showed only significant improvements in TUG, Mini-Best test, and sensory composite score. Conclusion. Cervical repetitive magnetic stimulation can help improve balance and functional ambulation and decreases the risk of falls in RRMS patients, especially in the mild, low disability cases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Fawaz","given":"Shereen I."},{"family":"Izumi","given":"Shin-Ichi"},{"family":"Hamada","given":"Soha M."},{"family":"Omara","given":"Abir A."},{"family":"Wassef","given":"Ghada O."},{"family":"Saber","given":"Heba Gamal"},{"family":"Salama","given":"Sherihan M."}],"citation-key":"fawazRoleCervicalSpinal2022","container-title":"Rehabilitation Research and Practice","container-title-short":"Rehabilitation Research and Practice","DOI":"10.1155/2022/6009104","editor":[{"family":"Fonte","given":"Cristina"}],"ISSN":"2090-2875, 2090-2867","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,21]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1-8","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Role of Cervical Spinal Magnetic Stimulation in Improving Posture and Functional Ambulation of Patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/rerp/2022/6009104/","volume":"2022"},{"id":"fazaziXlinkedHistoneDemethylases2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Fazazi","given":"Mohamed Reda"},{"family":"Ruda","given":"Gian Filippo"},{"family":"Brennan","given":"Paul E."},{"family":"Rangachari","given":"Manu"}],"citation-key":"fazaziXlinkedHistoneDemethylases2023","container-title":"Brain Research Bulletin","container-title-short":"Brain Research Bulletin","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainresbull.2023.110748","ISSN":"03619230","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10]]},"language":"en","page":"110748","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The X-linked histone demethylases KDM5C and KDM6A as regulators of T cell-driven autoimmunity in the central nervous system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0361923023001739","volume":"202"},{"id":"fedder-semmesAktmTORPathwayDrives2021","abstract":"In the vertebrate CNS, oligodendrocytes produce myelin, a specialized membrane, to insulate and support axons. Individual oligodendrocytes wrap multiple axons with myelin sheaths of variable lengths and thicknesses. Myelin grows at the distal ends of oligodendrocyte processes, and multiple lines of work have provided evidence that mRNAs and RNA binding proteins localize to myelin, together supporting a model where local translation controls myelin sheath growth. What signal transduction mechanisms could control this? One strong candidate is the Akt-mTOR pathway, a major cellular signaling hub that coordinates transcription, translation, metabolism, and cytoskeletal organization. Here, using zebrafish as a model system, we found that Akt-mTOR signaling promotes myelin sheath growth and stability during development. Through cell-specific manipulations to oligodendrocytes, we show that the Akt-mTOR pathway drives cap-dependent translation to promote myelination and that restoration of cap-dependent translation is sufficient to rescue myelin deficits in mTOR loss-of-function animals. Moreover, an mTOR-dependent translational regulator was phosphorylated and colocalized with mRNA encoding a canonically myelin-translated protein\n              in vivo\n              , and bioinformatic investigation revealed numerous putative translational targets in the myelin transcriptome.

Myelin membrane grows dramatically following initial axon wrapping in a process that demands protein and lipid synthesis. How protein and lipid synthesis is coordinated with the need for myelin to be generated in certain locations remains unknown. Our study reveals that the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway promotes myelin sheath growth by regulating protein translation. Because we found translational regulators of the Akt-mTOR pathway in myelin, our data raise the possibility that Akt-mTOR activity regulates translation in myelin sheaths to deliver myelin on demand to the places it is needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Fedder-Semmes","given":"Karlie N."},{"family":"Appel","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"fedder-semmesAktmTORPathwayDrives2021","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

As they begin to differentiate, OPCs undergo a series of highly regulated changes to morphology, gene expression, and membrane organization. This stage represents a critical bottleneck in oligodendrogliogenesis, and the regulatory program that guides it is still not fully understood. Here, we show that\n              in vivo\n              toxin-mediated cleavage of the vesicle associated SNARE proteins VAMP2/3 in the OL lineage of both male and female mice impairs the ability of early OLs to mature into functional, myelinating OLs. In the developing mouse spinal cord, many VAMP2/3-cleaved OLs appeared to stall in the premyelinating, early OL stage, resulting in an overall loss of both myelin density and OL number. The Src kinase Fyn, a key regulator of oligodendrogliogenesis and myelination, is highly expressed among premyelinating OLs, but its expression decreases as OLs mature. We found that OLs with cleaved VAMP2/3 in the spinal cord white matter showed significantly higher expression of Fyn compared with neighboring control cells, potentially because of an extended premyelinating stage. Overall, our results show that functional VAMP2/3 in OL lineage cells is essential for proper myelin formation and plays a major role in controlling the maturation and terminal differentiation of premyelinating OLs.\n            \n            \n              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT\n              The production of mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) is essential for CNS myelination during development, myelin remodeling in adulthood, and remyelination following injury or in demyelinating disease.

This stage acts as a critical checkpoint in OL development, and much is still unknown about the dynamic regulatory processes involved.

Hypoimmunogenic iPSCs are generated through CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules in healthy donor‐derived iPSCs and differentiated into OPCs.

Although no special diets are associated with MS, the impact of diet and dietary supplements on the course of progressive forms of the disease has been studied during the last few years. Fatigue is among the most common and disabling symptoms reported by MS patients. Fatigue has been defined in the Multiple Sclerosis Council for Clinical Practice Guidelines (MSCCPG, 1998) as a “subjective lack of physical and/or mental energy that the individual perceives as an interference with habitual and desired activities”. This study aimed to compare the psychometric functioning of the “Fatigue Severity Scale” (FSS) and the “Modified Fatigue Impact Scale” (MFIS) in our sample of people with MS. Specifically, during chronic treatment, the change in these two parameters with two vitamin-rich dietary supplements (Citozym® and Ergozym®) was evaluated. The impact of these nutritional supplements revealed differences in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory parameters among the volunteers in the treatment group, with a subsequent improvement in fatigue.

To analyze the immune reconstitution, we quantified the circulating immune cells in naïve and RR-EAE-affected mice after II, with BMC alone or in combination with MSC. Although II resulted in reduced numbers of circulating immune cells, reconstitution did not differ in co-transplanted mice. During the early phase of the disease, IL-4 was significantly elevated in co-transplanted mice, as compared to those treated with BMC alone.

Under neuroinflammatory conditions, such as MS, TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) is believed to mediate the pro-inflammatory activities associated with TNF, whereas TNF receptor-2 (TNFR2) may instead induce anti-inflammatory effects as well as promote remyelination and neuroprotection. In this study, we have investigated the therapeutic potential of blocking TNFR1 whilst simultaneously stimulating TNFR2 in a mouse model of MS.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG\n                35-55\n                ) in humanized TNFR1 knock-in mice.

It is the prodromal manifestation most strongly associated with the development of synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson’s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies. While individuals with iRBD exhibit significant cortical atrophy shaped by distinct gene expression, sex-specific differences in structural brain changes remain unknown. In this study, we investigate the effect of sex on brain atrophy in iRBD and examine the gene expression underpinning the brain abnormalities in a large international multicentric MRI dataset with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD.T1-weighted scans from 408 individuals with iRBD and 480 healthy controls were acquired. Vertex-based cortical surface reconstruction and segmentation were conducted, and general linear models were used to quantify brain atrophy and assess the sex effect on cortical thickness in iRBD compared to controls. We then used a high resolution parcellation to further characterize the sex differences and conduct imaging transcriptomics analyses. Gene enrichment analyses were performed to identify genes associated with sex differences in cortical atrophy in iRBD.Males with iRBD showed significantly more cortical thinning compared to females with iRBD and controls, despite similar age and clinical features. The gene enrichment analysis revealed that female-specific resilience in cortical atrophy was associated with overexpression of oestrogen-related receptors.These findings provide mechanistic insight of sex-specific neuroprotection in prodromal stages of synucleinopathies, highlighting the critical impact of sex on the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by grants to S R from Alzheimer Society Canada (0000000082) and Parkinson Canada (PPG 2023 0000000122) The work performed in Montreal was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Fonds de recherche du Quebec Sante (FRQ S), the W Garfield Weston Foundation, and F Hoffmann La Roche AG The work performed in Oxford was funded by Parkinsons UK (J 2101) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) The work performed in Prague was funded by the Czech Health Research Council grant NU21 04 00535 and by project nr LX22NPO5107 (MEYS) Financed by European Union Next Generation EU The work performed in Paris was funded by grants from the Programme dinvestissements davenir (ANR 10 IAIHU 06), the Paris Institute of Neurosciences IHU (IAIHU 06), the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR 11 INBS 0006), Electricite de France (Fondation dEntreprise EDF), Control PD (Joint Programme Neurodegenerative Disease Research JPND Cognitive Propagation in Prodromal Parkinsons disease), the Fondation Therese et Rene Planiol, the Fonds Saint Michel; by unrestricted support for research on Parkinsons disease from Energipole (M Mallart) and Societe Francaise de Medecine Esthetique (M Legrand); and by a grant from the Institut de France to Isabelle Arnulf (for the ALICE Study) The work performed in Sydney was supported by a Dementia Team Grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council (1095127) The work performed in Aarhus was supported by funding from the Lundbeck Foundation, Parkinsonforeningen (The Danish Parkinson Association), and the Jascha Foundation The work performed as part of the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), a public private partnership, was funded by the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinsons Research and funding partners, including 4D Pharma, AbbVie Inc, AcureX Therapeutics, Allergan, Amathus Therapeutics, Aligning Science Across Parkinsons (ASAP), Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, Bial Biotech, Biogen, BioLegend, Bristol Myers Squibb, Calico Life Sciences LLC, Celgene Corporation, DaCapo Brainscience, Denali Therapeutics, The Edmond J Safra Foundation, Eli Lilly and Company, GE Healthcare, GlaxoSmithKline, Golub Capital, Handl Therapeutics, Insitro, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Lundbeck, Merck and Co Inc, Meso Scale Diagnostics LLC, Neurocrine Biosciences, Pfizer Inc, Piramal Imaging, Prevail Therapeutics, F Hoffman La Roche Ltd and its affiliated company Genentech Inc, Sanofi Genzyme, Servier, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Teva Neuroscience Inc, UCB, Vanqua Bio, Verily Life Sciences, Voyager Therapeutics Inc, and Yumanity Therapeutics Inc For up to date information on the study, visit www ppmi info orgAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:All patients were part of ongoing prospective studies.

These symptoms increase with disease progression and lead to worsening disability, impaired activities of daily living and quality of life. Anti-spasticity medications and analgesics are of limited benefit or poorly tolerated. Cannabinoids may reduce spasticity and pain in people with MS. Demand for symptomatic treatment with cannabinoids is high. A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and harms of these drugs is required. OBJECTIVES: To assess benefit and harms of cannabinoids, including synthetic, or herbal and plant-derived cannabinoids, for reducing symptoms for adults with MS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases from inception to December 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library), CINAHL (EBSCO host), LILACS, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the US National Institutes of Health clinical trial register, the European Union Clinical Trials Register, the International Association for Cannabinoid Medicines databank. We hand searched citation lists of included studies and relevant reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised parallel or cross-over trials (RCTs) evaluating any cannabinoid (including herbal Cannabis, Cannabis flowers, plant-based cannabinoids, or synthetic cannabinoids) irrespective of dose, route, frequency, or duration of use for adults with MS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane Risk of bias 2 tool for parallel RCTs and crossover trials. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: reduction of 30% in the spasticity Numeric Rating Scale, pain relief of 50% or greater in the Numeric Rating Scale-Pain Intensity, much or very much improvement in the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs) (tolerability), serious adverse events (SAEs), nervous system disorders, psychiatric disorders, physical dependence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 RCTs with 3763 participants of whom 2290 received cannabinoids. Age ranged from 18 to 60 years, and between 50% and 88% participants across the studies were female. The included studies were 3 to 48 weeks long and compared nabiximols, an oromucosal spray with a plant derived equal (1:1) combination of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) (13 studies), synthetic cannabinoids mimicking THC (7 studies), an oral THC extract of Cannabis sativa (2 studies), inhaled herbal Cannabis (1 study) against placebo. One study compared dronabinol, THC extract of Cannabis sativa and placebo, one compared inhaled herbal Cannabis, dronabinol and placebo. We identified eight ongoing studies. Critical outcomes • Spasticity: nabiximols probably increases the number of people who report an important reduction of perceived severity of spasticity compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 2.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 4.04; 5 RCTs, 1143 participants; I(2) = 67%; moderate-certainty evidence). The absolute effect was 216 more people (95% CI 99 more to 332 more) per 1000 reporting benefit with cannabinoids than with placebo. • Chronic neuropathic pain: we found only one small trial that measured the number of participants reporting substantial pain relief with a synthetic cannabinoid compared with placebo (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 16.17; 1 study, 48 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether cannabinoids reduce chronic neuropathic pain intensity. • Treatment discontinuation due to AEs: cannabinoids may increase slightly the number of participants who discontinue treatment compared with placebo (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.84; 21 studies, 3110 participants; I² = 17%; low-certainty evidence); the absolute effect is 39 more people (95% CI 15 more to 76 more) per 1000 people. Important outcomes • PGIC: cannabinoids probably increase the number of people who report 'very much' or 'much' improvement in health status compared with placebo (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.36; 8 studies, 1215 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). The absolute effect is 113 more people (95% CI 57 more to 175 more) per 1000 people reporting improvement. • HRQoL: cannabinoids may have little to no effect on HRQoL (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.02; 8 studies, 1942 participants; I(2) = 0%; low-certainty evidence); • SAEs: cannabinoids may result in little to no difference in the number of participants who have SAEs compared with placebo (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.99; 20 studies, 3124 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence); • AEs of the nervous system: cannabinoids may increase nervous system disorders compared with placebo (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.44; 7 studies, 1154 participants; I² = 63%; low-certainty evidence); • Psychiatric disorders: cannabinoids may increase psychiatric disorders compared with placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.88; 6 studies, 1122 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence); • Drug tolerance: the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cannabinoids on drug tolerance (OR 3.07, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.95; 2 studies, 458 participants; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, nabiximols probably reduces the severity of spasticity in the short-term in people with MS. We are uncertain about the effect on chronic neurological pain and health-related quality of life. Cannabinoids may increase slightly treatment discontinuation due to AEs, nervous system and psychiatric disorders compared with placebo. We are uncertain about the effect on drug tolerance. The overall certainty of evidence is limited by short-term duration of the included studies.","author":[{"literal":"Filippini G"},{"literal":"Minozzi S"},{"literal":"Borrelli F"},{"literal":"Cinquini M"},{"literal":"Dwan K"}],"citation-key":"filippinigCannabisCannabinoidsSymptomatic2022","container-title":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD013444.pub2","ISSN":"1361-6137","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"Cd013444","title":"Cannabis and cannabinoids for symptomatic treatment for people with multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013444.pub2","volume":"5"},{"id":"fiorellasPersonalizedDietaryAdvices2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with osteoporosis, possibly due to neurological disability and decreased calcium intake. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a personalized nutritional advice program by a dietitian compared to the delivery of a standard advice form to optimize dietary calcium intake in outpatients with MS. METHODS: We performed a randomized, controlled, parallel trial comparing the efficacy of a personalized dietary advice (PDA) program to standard advice form (SAF) to increase daily calcium intake in MS patients. The study population was composed by patients with relapsing-remitting MS aged 18-69 years old. PDA program consisted in dietary advice delivered by a dietitian at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months. Calcium and nutrient intake in patients from both groups was evaluated at baseline and 6 months using a dietary survey. RESULTS: Of the 194 patients screened for inclusion, 182 patients were included (79% female, median age of 42 years, and median EDSS of 2.0), and randomized to SAF (n = 92) or PDA (n = 90). At 6 months, median calcium intake increased by 241 mg/day in the PDA group and decreased by 120 mg/day in the SAF group (p < 0.0001). However, the median calcium intake was 947 mg/day in the SAF group and 778 mg/day in the PDA group at baseline (p = 0.0077), potentially favoring the effect of dietary advice. Complementary analyses focusing on patients with insufficient calcium intakes at baseline revealed comparable values in both groups (p = 0.69). Of those, patients included in the PDA group obtained significantly higher calcium intakes at 6 months than patients from the SAF group (p = 0.0086) independently of EDSS, PASAT, HADS and EQ-5D scores. CONCLUSION: This work shows the efficacy of dietary management based on personalized advice program over 3 months to durably increase calcium consumption in MS patients with insufficient calcium intake.

Cannabis, an immunomodulating agent, is known for its ability to treat MS effectively. However, due to variations in the profile of secondary metabolites, especially cannabinoids, among cannabis cultivars, the effectiveness of cannabis treatment can vary, with significant variability in the effects on different biological parameters. For screening available cultivars, cellular in vitro as well as pre-clinical in vivo assays, are required to evaluate the effectiveness of the wide range of chemical variability that exists in cannabis cultivars. This study evaluated comparatively three chemically diverse cannabis cultivars, CN2, CN4 and CN6, containing different ratios of phytocannabinoids, for their neuroinflammatory activity in MS model.\n            \n            \n              Materials and methods\n              \n                In vitro\n                experiments were performed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated BV-2 microglia and primary glial cells to evaluate the effect of different cannabis cultivars on nitric oxide (NO) and inflammatory cytokines, as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression. An in vivo experiment using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS model was conducted using Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) as the activating peptide. The cannabis extracts of the cultivars CN2, CN4, CN6 or vehicle, were intraperitoneally injected with clinical scores given based on observed symptoms over the course of study. At the end of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed, and splenocyte cytokine secretion was measured using ELISA. Lumbar sections from the spinal cord of treated MS mice were evaluated for microglia, astrocytes and CD4\n                +\n                cells.\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              Extracts of the CN2 cultivar contained tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) without cannabidiol (CBD), and a number of monoterpenes. CN4 contained cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and tetrahydrocannabidiolic acid (THCA), with significant amounts of THC: CBD in a 1:1 ratio, as well as sesquiterpenes and some monoterpenes; and CN6 contained primarily CBDA and THCA, as well as THC and CBD in a 2:1 ratio, with some sesquiterpenes and no monoterpenes. All extracts were not cytotoxic in glial cells up to 50 µg/ml. Dose dependent inhibition of LPS-induced BV2 as well as primary microglial NO secretion confirmed the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activity of the three cannabis cultivars. CN2 but not CN4 reduced both astrocytosis and microglial activation in lumbar sections of EAE mice. In contrast, CN4 but not CN2 significantly decreased the secretion of TNFα and Interferon γ (IFNγ) in primary splenocytes extracted from EAE mice.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              While both cannabis cultivars, CN2 and CN4, significantly reduced the severity of the clinical signs throughout the course of the study, they modulated different inflammatory mediators and pathways, probably due to differences in their phytocannabinoid composition.

We therefore prospectively explored changes in soluble, humoral, and cellular immune components associated with TPE. We included ten patients with neurological autoimmune disorders that underwent TPE and assessed a panel of clinically relevant pathogen-specific antibodies, total serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, interleukin-6 (IL-6, pg/mL), C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/dL), procalcitonin (PCT, µg/L) and major lymphocyte subpopulations (cells/µL). Blood was collected prior to TPE (pre-TPE, baseline), immediately after TPE (post-TPE), as well as five weeks (follow-up1) and 130 days (follow-up2) following TPE. Pathogen-specific antibody levels were reduced by −86% (p < 0.05) post-TPE and recovered to 55% (follow-up1) and 101% (follow-up2). Ig subclasses were reduced by −70–89% (p < 0.0001) post-TPE with subsequent complete (IgM/IgA) and incomplete (IgG) recovery throughout the follow-ups. Mean IL-6 and CRP concentrations increased by a factor of 3–4 at post-TPE (p > 0.05) while PCT remained unaffected. We found no alterations in B- and T-cell populations. No adverse events related to TPE occurred. TPE induced a profound but transient reduction in circulating antibodies, while the investigated soluble immune components were not washed out.

Current disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis have limited effects on disability accrual unrelated to relapses, which is thought to be partially caused by chronic, nonresolving neuroinflammation within the central nervous system. Tolebrutinib is an oral, brain-penetrant Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets myeloid cells (including microglia) and B cells in both the periphery and central nervous system. There are no approved treatments for nonrelapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.\nMETHODS: In a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial, we randomly assigned participants with nonrelapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive tolebrutinib (60 mg once daily) or matching placebo. The primary end point was confirmed disability progression that was sustained for at least 6 months, assessed in a time-to-event analysis.\nRESULTS: A total of 1131 participants underwent randomization: 754 were assigned to receive tolebrutinib and 377 to receive placebo. The median follow-up was 133 weeks. A smaller percentage of participants in the tolebrutinib group than in the placebo group had confirmed disability progression sustained for at least 6 months (22.6% vs. 30.7%; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.88; P = 0.003). Serious adverse events occurred in 15.0% of the participants in the tolebrutinib group and in 10.4% of those in the placebo group. A total of 4.0% of the participants in the tolebrutinib group and 1.6% of those in the placebo group had increases in alanine aminotransferase levels to more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range.\nCONCLUSIONS: In participants with nonrelapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, the risk of disability progression was lower among those who received treatment with tolebrutinib than among those who received placebo.

In this systematic review, we tried to organize and synthesize data and themes from published literature regarding key aspects of AI tool implementation; namely procurement, integration, monitoring and evaluation and map the extracted themes on to the Plan-Do-Study-Act framework. We found that currently the majority of literature on AI implementation in healthcare settings focuses on the “Plan” and “Study” domains with considerably less emphasis on the “Do” and “Act” domains. This is perhaps the reason why experts currently cite the implementation of AI tools in healthcare settings as challenging. Furthermore, the current AI healthcare landscape has poor representation from low and lower-middle-income countries. To ensure, the healthcare industry is able to implement AI tool into clinical workforce, across a variety of settings globally, we call for diverse and inclusive collaborations, coupled with further research targeted on the under-investigated stages of AI implementation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,9]]},"citation-key":"FrameworksProcurementIntegration","language":"en","title":"Frameworks for procurement, integration, monitoring, and evaluation of artificial intelligence tools in clinical settings: A systematic review | PLOS Digital Health","title-short":"Frameworks for procurement, integration, monitoring, and evaluation of artificial intelligence tools in clinical settings","type":"webpage","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000514"},{"id":"frankAntibodyMediatedDepletionAutoreactive2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            Long-term therapeutic outcomes of multiple sclerosis (MS) remain hindered by the chronic nature of immune cell stimulation toward self-antigens. Development of novel methods to target and deplete autoreactive T lymphocytes remains an attractive target for therapeutics for MS. We developed a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)–targeted radiolabeled mAb and assessed its ability to deplete activated PD-1+ T lymphocytes in vitro and its ability to reduce disease burden of the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35–55 experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in C57BL/6 mice. We also investigated the upregulation of PD-1 on infiltrating lymphocytes in an animal model of MS. Finally, we demonstrate the (to our knowledge) first reported positron-emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of activated PD-1+ cells in the EAE animal model of MS. We found that the 177Lu radioisotope-labeled anti–PD-1 mAb demonstrated significant in vitro cytotoxicity toward activated CD4+PD-1+ T lymphocytes and led to significant reduction in overall disease progression in the EAE animal model. Our results show high expression of PD-1 on infiltrating lymphocytes in the spinal cords of EAE diseased animals. Positron-emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of the anti–PD-1 mAb demonstrated significant uptake in the cervical draining lymph nodes highlighting accumulation of activated lymphocytes. Targeted depletion of T lymphocytes using T cell activation markers such as PD-1 may present a novel method to reduce autoimmune attack and inflammation in autoimmune diseases such as MS.

An independent monitoring board analyzed the results of the analyses each time 40 patients were assessed on the main endpoint. Cranberry extract (36 mg proanthocyanidins per day) or a matching placebo was taken by participants twice daily for 1 year. The primary endpoint was the time to first symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), subject to validation by a validation committee. RESULTS: The second sequential analyses allowed us to accept the null hypothesis (no difference between cranberry and placebo). There was no difference in time to first symptomatic UTI distribution across 1 year, with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.99, 95% CI [0.61, 1.60] (p = 0.97).

Vitamin D deficiency is an established risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis—the autoimmune demyelinating and degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Several studies confirmed that higher vitamin D serum level is associated with better clinical and radiological outcomes in patients with multiple sclerosis, whereas vitamin D supplementation benefits in multiple sclerosis remain inconclusive. Despite that, many experts suggest regular measurements of vitamin D serum levels and supplementation in patients with multiple sclerosis. In this study, 133 patients with multiple sclerosis (relapsing–remitting subtype) were prospectively observed in a 0-, 12- and 24-month time span in a clinical setting. The study group consisted of 71.4% of patients (95 out of 133) supplementing vitamin D. The associations between vitamin D serum levels, clinical outcomes (disability status expressed by EDSS, number of relapses and time to relapse) and radiological outcomes (new T2-weighted lesions and number of gadolinium-enhanced lesions) were evaluated. There were no statistically significant correlations between clinical outcomes and vitamin D serum levels or supplementations. Fewer new T2-weighted lesions were observed in patients with vitamin D supplementations (p = 0.034) in 24 months of observation. Moreover, an optimal or higher level of vitamin D (>30 ng/mL) maintained throughout the entire observation period was associated with a lower number of new T2-weighted lesions in 24 months of observation (p = 0.045). These results support vitamin D implementation commencement and amelioration in patients with multiple sclerosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Galus","given":"Weronika"},{"family":"Chmiela","given":"Tomasz"},{"family":"Walawska-Hrycek","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Krzystanek","given":"Ewa"}],"citation-key":"galusRadiologicalBenefitsVitamin2023","container-title":"Nutrients","container-title-short":"Nutrients","DOI":"10.3390/nu15061465","ISSN":"2072-6643","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,17]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1465","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Radiological Benefits of Vitamin D Status and Supplementation in Patients with MS—A Two-Year Prospective Observational Cohort Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/6/1465","volume":"15"},{"id":"ganesanEnhancementBalanceMobility2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ganesan","given":"Mohan"},{"family":"Skias","given":"Demetrios"},{"family":"Aruin","given":"Alexander S."}],"citation-key":"ganesanEnhancementBalanceMobility2021","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2021.103167","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"language":"en","page":"103167","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Enhancement of balance, and mobility in individuals with multiple sclerosis using visual cue guided multidirectional step training - A pilot study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S221103482100434X","volume":"55"},{"id":"gaoIcariinAmelioratesBehavioral2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gao","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Ceng-ceng"},{"family":"Hao","given":"Jin-ping"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Cui-cui"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Chao-ying"}],"citation-key":"gaoIcariinAmelioratesBehavioral2023","container-title":"Brain Research","container-title-short":"Brain Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.brainres.2023.148267","ISSN":"00068993","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4]]},"language":"en","page":"148267","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Icariin ameliorates behavioral deficits and neuropathology in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006899323000379","volume":"1804"},{"id":"gaoTreatmentAnacardicAcid2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gao","given":"Yu-Han"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yu-Xin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jia-Qi"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Meng-Yuan"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Zhuo-Hua"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Ya-Nan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Li-Bin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xing"}],"citation-key":"gaoTreatmentAnacardicAcid2022","container-title":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","container-title-short":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.04.115","ISSN":"0006291X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"language":"en","page":"34-40","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Treatment with anacardic acid modulates dendritic cell activation and alleviates the disease development of autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006291X2200657X","volume":"613"},{"id":"garcia-gonzalezAPOEHaplotypePhasing2025","abstract":"Background The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a key genetic determinant of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk, with the ε4 allele significantly increasing susceptibility. While the pathogenic effects of the ε4 allele are well established, the functional impact of distinct haplotype configurations within the broader ε3 and ε4 backgrounds remains poorly understood. This study investigates the role of intragenic sub haplotypes in modulating APOE expression and their potential influence on AD progression.Methods We utilized Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long-read sequencing to phase variants within a 4-kilobase comprising the APOE locus in a cohort of 1,265 individuals with known APOE genotypes. We evaluated the impact of the identified intragenic haplotypes on APOE protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using the Olink platform, adjusting for demographic and molecular covariates. Statistical modeling was employed to assess the independent effects of these haplotypes alongside traditional APOE genotypes. Additionally, their influence on dementia progression in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects was analyzed using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.Results Our analysis identified 48 Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) within a 4-kilobase region containing the APOE gene, including nine novel variants. Phasing of variants within the APOE locus revealed 59 unique haplotypes in the Spanish population, which were grouped into five major haplogroups—ε2, ε3A, ε3B, ε4A, and ε4B—including two common haplogroups for each of the ε3 and ε4 isoforms. The ε4A haplogroup was associated with a significant decrease in APOE ε4 protein levels in CSF (p = 0.004), suggesting a regulatory mechanism that may mitigate the toxic gain-of-function effect typically attributed to the ε4 allele. Conversely, the ε3B haplogroup was linked to increased APOE ε3 protein levels in ε3/ε4 carriers (p = 0.025), potentially serving a compensatory role. These effects were independent of overall APOE genotype and remained significant after adjusting for covariates. Both haplogroups (ε4A and ε3B) demonstrated protective effects in the progression from MCI to dementia, underscoring their potential relevance in Alzheimer’s disease.Conclusions This study provides new insights into the intragenic allelic variability of the APOE gene, demonstrating that intragenic APOE haplogroups within the ε3 and ε4 backgrounds can modulate APOE isoform expression in ways that might modulate AD. Our findings highlight the importance of considering haplotype-specific effects when interpreting the functional impact of APOE and in designing targeted therapeutic strategies. Further research is needed to explore the broader regulatory network of the APOE locus and its interaction with neighboring loci in the 19q13 region.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementAuthors acknowledge the support of the Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (VLAIO) grant N PR067/21 and Janssen for the HARPONE project and the ADAPTED project the EU/EFPIA Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking Grant N 115975.

These lesions mainly consist of phagocytes that play a key role in lesion progression and remyelination, and therefore represent a promising therapeutic target in MS. We recently showed that unsaturated fatty acids produced by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 induce inflammatory foam cell formation during demyelination. These fatty acids are elongated by the “elongation of very long chain fatty acids” proteins (ELOVLs), generating a series of functionally distinct lipids. Here, we show that the expression and activity of ELOVLs are altered in myelin-induced foam cells. Especially ELOVL6, an enzyme responsible for converting saturated and monounsaturated C16 fatty acids into C18 species, was found to be up-regulated in myelin phagocytosing phagocytes in vitro and in MS lesions. Depletion of\n              Elovl6\n              induced a repair-promoting phagocyte phenotype through activation of the S1P/PPARγ pathway.\n              Elovl6\n              -deficient foamy macrophages showed enhanced ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux, increased production of neurotrophic factors, and reduced expression of inflammatory mediators.

Here, we review the role of BTK in different cell signaling pathways, the development of BTKi in B-cell malignancies, and their emerging role in the treatment of MS and other autoimmune disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Garg","given":"Neeta"},{"family":"Padron","given":"Elizabeth Jordan"},{"family":"Rammohan","given":"Kottil W."},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Courtney Frances"}],"citation-key":"gargBrutonsTyrosineKinase2022","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","container-title-short":"JCM","DOI":"10.3390/jcm11206139","ISSN":"2077-0383","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,18]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"6139","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors: The Next Frontier of B-Cell-Targeted Therapies for Cancer, Autoimmune Disorders, and Multiple Sclerosis","title-short":"Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/20/6139","volume":"11"},{"id":"garodiaCurcuminInflammationNeurological2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Garodia","given":"Prachi"},{"family":"Hegde","given":"Mangala"},{"family":"Kunnumakkara","given":"Ajaikumar B."},{"family":"Aggarwal","given":"Bharat B."}],"citation-key":"garodiaCurcuminInflammationNeurological2023","container-title":"Integrative Medicine Research","container-title-short":"Integrative Medicine Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.imr.2023.100968","ISSN":"22134220","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","page":"100968","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Curcumin, inflammation, and neurological disorders: How are they linked?","title-short":"Curcumin, inflammation, and neurological disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213422023000471","volume":"12"},{"id":"gauntMSRemyelinatingDrug2021","abstract":"The retinoid X receptor agonist bexarotene promotes remyelination in patients with multiple sclerosis.

One promising strategy to control progression of MS is the inhibition of the enzyme Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), which is centrally involved in the activation of both B cells and myeloid cells, such as macrophages and microglia. The benefit of BTK inhibition by evobrutinib was shown as we observed reduced pro-inflammatory activation of microglia when treating chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or following the adoptive transfer of activated T cells. Additionally, in a model of toxic demyelination, evobrutinib-mediated BTK inhibition promoted the clearance of myelin debris by microglia, leading to an accelerated remyelination.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous risk variants, but their functional impact on gene regulation remains largely unknown. A major challenge lies in interpreting the function of non-coding variants, which comprise the majority of GWAS hits, making it difficult to determine their functional consequences, particularly in identifying the target genes and cell types involved.Methods We investigated the disruption and enhancement of transcription factor (TF) binding motifs by schizophrenia-associated GWAS SNPs in 15 cortical cell types of the human brain. We integrated single-nucleus ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from 71 donors (36 affected by schizophrenia) with GWAS summary statistics to identify TF motifs whose binding affinities are altered by schizophrenia-associated SNPs.Results We found that risk SNPs predominantly disrupt TF binding, while protective alleles show a more balanced effect with both disruptions and enhancements of TF binding. Furthermore, we demonstrated that disrupted TF motifs can lead to altered expression of target genes, including NAGA in excitatory neurons and HLA-B in oligodendrocyte precursor cells. These genes have been previously implicated in schizophrenia and our study provides a mechanism for their dysregulation through altered TF binding.Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of considering cell type-specific effects and provide a genome-wide map of TF motif disruptions in schizophrenia, offering insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying disease risk. These findings may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting specific regulatory mechanisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Hope for Depression Research Foundation.

In this study, we investigated the metabolic profile of FA synthesis using combination therapy of melatonin and diisopropylamine dichloroacetate (DADA), a PDK4 inhibitor, in EAE mice. Disease progression was monitored by recording the disability scores. Immunological, oligodendrogenesis and metabolic factors were also evaluated. Results showed that combination therapy of melatonin and DADA significantly reduced EAE disability scores, compared to melatonin, whereas DADA alone did not have any effect. In addition, co-therapy inhibited pro-inflammatory while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines, significantly better than melatonin alone. Moreover, administration of combination drugs recovered the declined expression of oligodendrocytic markers in EAE, more potently than melatonin. Furthermore, co-therapy affected cerebral energy metabolism by significantly reducing lactate levels while increasing N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase (HMGCR) levels. Finally, while melatonin increased lactate and PDK4 expression levels and greatly reduced PDC activity, co-therapy significantly restored PDC function while reducing the lactate levels.

Phagocytic and regenerative functions of these CNS innate immune cells support remyelination, whereas chronic and maladaptive inflammatory activation promotes lesion expansion and disability, particularly in the progressive forms of MS. No currently approved drugs convincingly target microglia and macrophages within the CNS, contributing to the critical lack of therapies promoting remyelination and slowing progression in MS. Here, we found that the protein kinase C (PKC)-modulating drug bryostatin-1 (bryo-1), a CNS-penetrant compound with an established human safety profile, produces a shift in microglia and CNS macrophage transcriptional programs from pro-inflammatory to regenerative phenotypes, both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of microglia with bryo-1 prevented the activation of neurotoxic astrocytes while stimulating scavenger pathways, phagocytosis, and secretion of factors that promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. In line with these findings, systemic treatment with bryo-1 augmented remyelination following a focal demyelinating injury in vivo. Our results demonstrate the potential of bryo-1 and functionally related PKC modulators as myelin regenerative and neuroprotective agents in MS and other neurologic diseases through therapeutic targeting of microglia and CNS-associated macrophages.\n          \n            One Sentence Summary\n            PKC modulation in CNS innate immune cells favors the activation of a beneficial phenotype that promotes myelin regeneration and neuroprotection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gharibani","given":"Payam"},{"family":"Abramson","given":"Efrat"},{"family":"Shanmukha","given":"Shruthi"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Godfrey","given":"Wesley H."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Judy J."},{"family":"Hu","given":"Jingwen"},{"family":"Baydyuk","given":"Maryna"},{"family":"Dorion","given":"Marie-France"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Xiaojing"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Hwang","given":"Soonmyung"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jeffrey K."},{"family":"Calabresi","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Kornberg","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Paul M."}],"citation-key":"gharibaniPKCModulatorBryostatin12023","DOI":"10.1101/2023.08.28.555084","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Neuroscience","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"PKC modulator bryostatin-1 therapeutically targets CNS innate immunity to attenuate neuroinflammation and promote remyelination","type":"article","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2023.08.28.555084"},{"id":"ghazaryanCronassialAmelioratesAutoimmune2023","abstract":"In recent years, the pathogenetic role of oxidative stress in damaging myelin cells, a precursor to the development of myelin-related diseases such as multiple sclerosis, has gained increasing significance.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects the CNS, and it is the leading cause of disability in young adults. Lysolecithin (LPC) is one of the best toxin-induced demyelination models. In this study, a suitable model is created, and the effect of fluoxetine treatment is examined on this model. In this case, it was assumed that daily fluoxetine treatment had increased the endogenous remyelination in the LPC model. This study was focused on investigating the influence of the fluoxetine dose of 5 or 10 mg/kg per day for 1 and 4 weeks on LPC-induced neurotoxicity in the corpus callosum region. It was performed as a demyelinating model in male Wistar rats. After 3 days, fluoxetine was injected intraperitoneally (5 or 10 mg/kg per day) for 1 and 4 weeks in each group. After completing the treatment course, the corpus callosum was removed to examine the gene expression and histological analysis was performed. The results of the histopathological study of hematoxylin and eosin staining of the corpus callosum showed that in 1 and 4-week treatment groups, fluoxetine has reduced the level of inflammation at the LPC injection site (5 and 10 mg/kg per day). Fluoxetine treatment in the luxol fast blue (LFB) staining of the corpus callosum has been led to an increase in myelination capacity in all doses and times. The results of the genetic study showed that the fluoxetine has significantly reduced the expression level of tumor necrosis factor-α, nuclear factor κβ, and induced nitric oxide synthase in comparison with the untreated LPC group. Also, the fluoxetine treatment has enhanced the expression level of the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) gene in comparison with the untreated group. Fluoxetine has increased the expression level of myelination and neurotrophic genes such as myelin basic protein (MBP), oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The outcomes demonstrated that fluoxetine reduces inflammation and strengthens the endogenous myelination in the LPC-induced demyelination model; however, supplementary studies are required for specifying the details of its mechanisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gholami","given":"Elham"},{"family":"Gholami","given":"Mohammad Reza"},{"family":"Tavakoli","given":"Asadollah"},{"family":"Ahmadi","given":"Mahdie"},{"family":"Rezaian","given":"Jafar"},{"family":"Alipour","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Chehelcheraghi","given":"Farzaneh"},{"family":"Khaksarian","given":"Mojtaba"}],"citation-key":"gholamiEffectFluoxetineTreatment2022","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology","container-title-short":"Can.

Effective drugs that target the inflammation can only partially reduce accumulation of neurological deficits and conversion to progressive disease forms. Diet and the associated gut microbiome are currently being discussed as crucial environmental risk factors that determine disease onset and subsequent progression. In people with multiple sclerosis, supplementation of the short-chain fatty acid propionic acid, as a microbial metabolite derived from the fermentation of a high-fiber diet, has previously been shown to regulate inflammation accompanied by neuroprotective properties. We set out to determine whether the neuroprotective impact of propionic acid is a direct mode of action of short-chain fatty acids on CNS neurons. We analysed neurite recovery in the presence of the short-chain fatty acid propionic acid and butyric acid in a reverse-translational disease-in-a-dish model of human-induced primary neurons differentiated from people with multiple sclerosis-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. We found that recovery of damaged neurites is induced by propionic acid and butyric acid. We could also show that administration of butyric acid is able to enhance propionic acid-associated neurite recovery. Whole-cell proteome analysis of induced primary neurons following recovery in the presence of propionic acid revealed abundant changes of protein groups that are associated with the chromatin assembly, translational, and metabolic processes. We further present evidence that these alterations in the chromatin assembly were associated with inhibition of histone deacetylase class I/II following both propionic acid and butyric acid treatment, mediated by free fatty acid receptor signalling. While neurite recovery in the presence of propionic acid is promoted by activation of the anti-oxidative response, administration of butyric acid increases neuronal ATP synthesis in people with multiple sclerosis-specific induced primary neurons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gisevius","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Duscha","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Poschmann","given":"Gereon"},{"family":"Stühler","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Motte","given":"Jeremias"},{"family":"Fisse","given":"Anna Lena"},{"family":"Augustyniak","given":"Sanja"},{"family":"Rehm","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Renk","given":"Pia"},{"family":"Böse","given":"Celina"},{"family":"Hubert","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Kathrin"},{"family":"Jagst","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Gömer","given":"André"},{"family":"Todt","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Bader","given":"Verian"},{"family":"Tokic","given":"Marianne"},{"family":"Hirschberg","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Krogias","given":"Christos"},{"family":"Trampe","given":"Nadine"},{"family":"Coutourier","given":"Charlotta"},{"family":"Winnesberg","given":"Carmen"},{"family":"Steinmann","given":"Eike"},{"family":"Winklhofer","given":"Konstanze"},{"family":"Gold","given":"Ralf"},{"family":"Haghikia","given":"Aiden"}],"citation-key":"giseviusPropionicAcidPromotes2024","container-title":"Brain Communications","DOI":"10.1093/braincomms/fcae182","ISSN":"2632-1297","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,3]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"fcae182","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Propionic acid promotes neurite recovery in damaged multiple sclerosis neurons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcae182/7686562","volume":"6"},{"id":"glabskadVitaminSupplementationMental2021","abstract":"Vitamin D has a promising role in multiple sclerosis (MS) management, and it has been found to be beneficial for patients' mental health, which is reduced in MS patients. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in MS patients. The systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020155779) and it was conducted on the basis of the PRISMA guidelines. The search procedure was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science databases and it included studies published up until September 2021. Six studies were included in the systematic review. The risk of bias was analyzed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Within the included studies, there were two studies randomized against placebo and four other prospective studies. The studies presented vitamin D interventions randomized against placebo or not randomized, while supplementation was applied for various durations-from 4 weeks to 12 months, or the studies compared patients who applied vitamin D supplementation and those who did not apply it and verified the effect of the supplementation after a number of years. The mental health outcomes that were assessed included quality of life, depression/depressive symptoms, and fatigue as an additional element. The majority of studies supported the positive influence of vitamin D on the mental health of MS patients, including the study characterized as having the highest quality (randomized against placebo with the highest NOS score). All the studies that assessed the quality of life indicated the positive influence of vitamin D while the studies that did not find a positive influence of vitamin D were conducted for depression/depressive symptoms. In spite of the fact that only a small number of studies have been conducted so far, and only two studies were randomized against a placebo, some conclusions may be formulated. The systematic review allowed us to conclude that there may be a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation in MS patients, which was stated in all of the studies analyzing quality of life, as well as in one study analyzing depressive symptoms. Considering that vitamin D deficiency is common in MS patients, and the potential positive influence of supplementation on the quality of life, supplementation should be applied at least in doses that cover the recommended intake.","author":[{"literal":"Głąbska D"},{"literal":"Kołota A"},{"literal":"Lachowicz K"},{"literal":"Skolmowska D"},{"literal":"Stachoń M"},{"literal":"Guzek D"}],"citation-key":"glabskadVitaminSupplementationMental2021","container-title":"Nutrients","DOI":"10.3390/nu13124207","ISSN":"2072-6643","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"title":"Vitamin D supplementation and mental health in multiple sclerosis patients: a systematic review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13124207","volume":"13"},{"id":"GlobalCommsReport2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,31]]},"citation-key":"GlobalCommsReport2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"English","page":"22","publisher":"Cision and PR Week","title":"Global Comms Report: Elevating & Evolving","type":"report","URL":"https://www.cision.co.uk/resources/white-papers/2024-global-comms-report/2024-global-comms-report-download/"},{"id":"GlossaryArtificialIntelligence","abstract":"Definition of some words linked with AI","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,25]]},"citation-key":"GlossaryArtificialIntelligence","container-title":"Artificial Intelligence","language":"en-GB","title":"Glossary - Artificial Intelligence - www.coe.int","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.coe.int/en/web/artificial-intelligence/glossary"},{"id":"godseNanocarriermediatedCurcuminDelivery2023","abstract":"Neurological disorders are a major global challenge, which counts for a substantial slice of disease burden around the globe. In these, the challenging landscape of central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and neuro-AIDS, demands innovative and novel therapeutic approaches. Curcumin, a versatile natural compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, shows great potential as a CNS adjuvant therapy. However, its limited bioavailability and suboptimal permeability to the blood–brain barrier (BBB) hamper the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin. This review explores how nanocarrier facilitates curcumin delivery, which has shown therapeutic efficacy for various non-CNS diseases, for example, cancers, and can also revolutionize the treatment outcomes in patients with CNS diseases. Toward this, intranasal administration of curcumin as a non-invasive CNS drug delivery route can also aid its therapeutic outcomes as an adjuvant therapy for CNS diseases. Intranasal delivery of nanocarriers with curcumin improves the bioavailability of curcumin and its BBB permeability, which is instrumental in promoting its therapeutic potential. Furthermore, curcumin’s inhibitory effect on efflux transporters will help to enhance the BBB and cellular permeability of various CNS drugs. The therapeutic potential of curcumin as an adjuvant has the potential to yield synergistic effects with CNS drugs and will help to reduce CNS drug doses and improve their safety profile. Taken together, this approach holds a promise for reshaping CNS disease management by maximizing curcumin’s and other drugs’ therapeutic benefits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Godse","given":"Sandip"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Lina"},{"family":"Sakshi","given":"Swarna"},{"family":"Singla","given":"Bhupesh"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Udai P"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Santosh"}],"citation-key":"godseNanocarriermediatedCurcuminDelivery2023","container-title":"Experimental Biology and Medicine","container-title-short":"Exp Biol Med (Maywood)","DOI":"10.1177/15353702231211863","ISSN":"1535-3702, 1535-3699","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,6]]},"language":"en","page":"15353702231211863","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Nanocarrier-mediated curcumin delivery: An adjuvant strategy for CNS disease treatment","title-short":"Nanocarrier-mediated curcumin delivery","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15353702231211863"},{"id":"golabiRoleCobalaminMultiple2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Golabi","given":"Marjan"},{"family":"Kazemi","given":"Danial"},{"family":"Chadeganipour","given":"Amir Shayan"},{"family":"Fouladseresht","given":"Hamed"},{"family":"Sullman","given":"Mark J.

Although immunosuppressive drugs are used to suppress symptoms, no definitive therapy exists. As in the experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, a partial sequence of the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35–55) was identified as a causative autoantigen. This suggests that the induction of immune tolerance that is specific to MOG35–55 would be a fundamental treatment for EAE. We previously reported that lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing an anionic phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS), in their lipid composition, can be used to deliver mRNA and that this leads to proteins of interest to be expressed in the spleen. In addition to the targeting capability of PS, PS molecules avoid activating the immune system. Physiologically, the recognition of PS on apoptotic cells suppresses immune activation against these cells by releasing cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β that negatively regulate immunity.

Hence, this relates to replacement of lost oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths—the primary targets of autoimmune attacks.

The analysis reveals a structural engagement shift around mid-July 2024, suggesting platform-level changes that influenced engagement metrics for all accounts under examination. The date at which the structural break (spike) in engagement occurs coincides with Elon Musk’s formal endorsement of Donald Trump on 13th July 2024. <br/><br/>In Phase One, focused on Elon Musk’s account, the analysis identified a marked differential uplift across all engagement metrics (view counts, retweet counts, and favourite counts) following the detected change point. Musk’s account not only started with a higher baseline compared to the other accounts in the analysis but also received a significant additional boost post-change, indicating a potential algorithmic adjustment that preferentially enhanced visibility and interaction for Musk’s posts.<br/><br/>In Phase Two, comparing Republican-leaning and Democrat-leaning accounts, we again observed an engagement shift around the same date, affecting all metrics. However, only view counts showed evidence of a group-specific boost, with Republican-leaning accounts exhibiting a significant post-change increase relative to Democrat-leaning accounts. This finding suggests a possible recommendation bias favouring Republican content in terms of visibility, potentially via recommendation mechanisms such as the \"For You\" feed. Conversely, retweet and favourite counts did not display the same group-specific boost, indicating a more balanced distribution of engagement across political alignments.<br/><br/>Overall, the results imply that while some aspects of engagement on the platform appear to have been enhanced broadly, specific visibility advantages may have been selectively applied, raising important questions about the potential impact of algorithmic adjustments on public discourse and the ‘neutrality’ of social media platforms as information carriers.<br/>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Graham","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Andrejevic","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"grahamComputationalAnalysisPotential2024","genre":"Working Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,1]]},"language":"en","license":"free_to_read","source":"eprints.qut.edu.au","title":"A computational analysis of potential algorithmic bias on platform X during the 2024 US election","type":"report","URL":"https://eprints.qut.edu.au/253211/"},{"id":"grassiIdentificationLipidAntigens2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Grassi","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Cabitta","given":"Livia"},{"family":"Prioni","given":"Simona"},{"family":"Mauri","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Ciampa","given":"Maria Grazia"},{"family":"Yokoyama","given":"Noriko"},{"family":"Iwabuchi","given":"Kazuhisa"},{"family":"Zorina","given":"Yana"},{"family":"Prinetti","given":"Alessandro"}],"citation-key":"grassiIdentificationLipidAntigens2023","container-title":"Neurochemical Research","container-title-short":"Neurochem Res","DOI":"10.1007/s11064-023-03859-2","ISSN":"0364-3190, 1573-6903","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6]]},"language":"en","page":"1783-1797","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Identification of the Lipid Antigens Recognized by rHIgM22, a Remyelination-Promoting Antibody","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11064-023-03859-2","volume":"48"},{"id":"gravenWenger1998Communities2003","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Graven","given":"Mellony"},{"family":"Lerman","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"gravenWenger1998Communities2003","container-title":"Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education","container-title-short":"Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education","DOI":"10.1023/A:1023947624004","ISSN":"1573-1820","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"185-194","source":"Springer Link","title":"Wenger, E.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the highest form of evidence on the effectiveness of a potential new treatment regimen, but they are extremely expensive and time consuming to conduct. Consequently, much focus has been given in recent years to innovative design and analysis methods that could improve the efficiency of RCTs. In this article, we review the current use and future potential of these methods within the context of IMID trials.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We provide a review of several innovative methods that would provide utility in IMID research. These include novel study designs (adaptive trials, Sequential Multi-Assignment Randomised Trials, basket, and umbrella trials) and data analysis methodologies (augmented analyses of composite responder endpoints, using high-dimensional biomarker information to stratify patients, and emulation of RCTs from routinely collected data). IMID trials are now well-placed to embrace innovative methods. For example, well-developed statistical frameworks for adaptive trial design are ready for implementation, whilst the growing availability of historical datasets makes the use of Bayesian methods particularly applicable.\n              To assess whether and how these innovative methods have been used in practice, we conducted a review via PubMed of clinical trials pertaining to any of 51 IMIDs that were published between 2018 and 20 in five high impact factor clinical journals.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Amongst 97 articles included in the review, 19 (19.6%) used an innovative design method, but most of these were relatively straightforward examples of innovative approaches.

However, the mechanisms by which hNSC transplantation leads to an increase in Tregs in the CNS remains unclear. We report that hNSCs drive the conversion of T conventional (Tconv) cells into Tregs in vitro. Conversion of Tconv cells is Ag driven and fails to occur in the absence of TCR stimulation by cognate antigenic self-peptides. Furthermore, CNS Ags are sufficient to drive this conversion in the absence of hNSCs in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, only Ags presented in the thymus during T cell selection drive this Treg response. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms by which hNSC Ags drive the conversion of Tconv cells into Tregs and may provide key insight needed for the development of MS therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Greilach","given":"Scott A"},{"family":"McIntyre","given":"Laura L"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Quy H"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Kessenbrock","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Lane","given":"Thomas E"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"Craig M"}],"citation-key":"greilachPresentationHumanNeural2023","container-title":"The Journal of Immunology","DOI":"10.4049/jimmunol.2200798","ISSN":"0022-1767, 1550-6606","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/pages/standard-publication-reuse-rights","page":"1677-1686","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Presentation of Human Neural Stem Cell Antigens Drives Regulatory T Cell Induction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jimmunol/article/210/11/1677/7930393","volume":"210"},{"id":"greshakeNotWhatYou2023","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various applications. The functionalities of recent LLMs can be flexibly modulated via natural language prompts. This renders them susceptible to targeted adversarial prompting, e.g., Prompt Injection (PI) attacks enable attackers to override original instructions and employed controls. So far, it was assumed that the user is directly prompting the LLM. But, what if it is not the user prompting? We argue that LLM-Integrated Applications blur the line between data and instructions. We reveal new attack vectors, using Indirect Prompt Injection, that enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved. We derive a comprehensive taxonomy from a computer security perspective to systematically investigate impacts and vulnerabilities, including data theft, worming, information ecosystem contamination, and other novel security risks. We demonstrate our attacks' practical viability against both real-world systems, such as Bing's GPT-4 powered Chat and code-completion engines, and synthetic applications built on GPT-4. We show how processing retrieved prompts can act as arbitrary code execution, manipulate the application's functionality, and control how and if other APIs are called. Despite the increasing integration and reliance on LLMs, effective mitigations of these emerging threats are currently lacking. By raising awareness of these vulnerabilities and providing key insights into their implications, we aim to promote the safe and responsible deployment of these powerful models and the development of robust defenses that protect users and systems from potential attacks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Greshake","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Abdelnabi","given":"Sahar"},{"family":"Mishra","given":"Shailesh"},{"family":"Endres","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Holz","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Fritz","given":"Mario"}],"citation-key":"greshakeNotWhatYou2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2302.12173","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,5]]},"number":"arXiv:2302.12173","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Not what you've signed up for: Compromising Real-World LLM-Integrated Applications with Indirect Prompt Injection","title-short":"Not what you've signed up for","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12173"},{"id":"grossMultipleSclerosisEndophenotypes2024","abstract":"One of the biggest challenges in managing multiple sclerosis is the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations and progression trajectories. It still remains to be elucidated whether this heterogeneity is reflected by discrete immune signatures in the blood as a surrogate of disease pathophysiology. Accordingly, individualized treatment selection based on immunobiological principles is still not feasible. Using two independent multicentric longitudinal cohorts of patients with early multiple sclerosis (\n              n\n              = 309 discovery and\n              n\n              = 232 validation), we were able to identify three distinct peripheral blood immunological endophenotypes by a combination of high-dimensional flow cytometry and serum proteomics, followed by unsupervised clustering. Longitudinal clinical and paraclinical follow-up data collected for the cohorts revealed that these endophenotypes were associated with disease trajectories of inflammation versus early structural damage. Investigating the capacity of immunotherapies to normalize endophenotype-specific immune signatures revealed discrete effect sizes as illustrated by the limited effect of interferon-β on endophenotype 3–related immune signatures. Accordingly, patients who fell into endophenotype 3 subsequently treated with interferon-β exhibited higher disease progression and MRI activity over a 4-year follow-up compared with treatment with other therapies. We therefore propose that ascertaining a patient’s blood immune signature before immunomodulatory treatment initiation may facilitate prediction of clinical disease trajectories and enable personalized treatment decisions based on pathobiological principles.\n            \n          , \n            Three discrete immunological endophenotypes in early multiple sclerosis correlate with distinct disease trajectories and treatment responses.\n          , \n            Editor’s summary\n            \n              The autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is a highly heterogeneous disease with many different treatment options.

This decline is particularly evident in multiple sclerosis (MS), which has been suggested to exhibit features of accelerated biological aging. Whether cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, contributes to remyelination impairment remains unknown. Here, we show that senescent cells (SCs) accumulate within demyelinated lesions after injury, and their elimination enhances remyelination in young mice but not in aged mice. In young mice, we observed the upregulation of senescence-associated transcripts primarily in microglia after demyelination, followed by their reduction during remyelination. However, in aged mice, senescence-associated factors persisted within lesions, correlating with inefficient remyelination. We found that SC elimination enhanced remyelination in young mice but was ineffective in aged mice. Proteomic analysis of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) revealed elevated levels of CCL11/Eotaxin-1 in lesions, which was found to inhibit efficient oligodendrocyte maturation. These results suggest therapeutic targeting of SASP components, such as CCL11, may improve remyelination in aging and MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gross","given":"Phillip S."},{"family":"Laforet","given":"Violeta Duran"},{"family":"Manavi","given":"Zeeba"},{"family":"Zia","given":"Sameera"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Sung Hyun"},{"family":"Shults","given":"Nataliia"},{"family":"Selva","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Alvarez","given":"Enrique"},{"family":"Plemel","given":"Jason R."},{"family":"Schafer","given":"Dorothy P."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jeffrey K."}],"citation-key":"grossSenescentlikeMicrogliaLimit2024","DOI":"10.1101/2024.05.23.595605","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,26]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Neuroscience","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Senescent-like microglia limit remyelination through the senescence associated secretory phenotype","type":"article","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2024.05.23.595605"},{"id":"gruberBTKRegulatesMicroglial2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gruber","given":"Ross C."},{"family":"Wirak","given":"Gregory S."},{"family":"Blazier","given":"Anna S."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Lan"},{"family":"Dufault","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Hagan","given":"Nellwyn"},{"family":"Chretien","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"LaMorte","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Hammond","given":"Timothy R."},{"family":"Cheong","given":"Agnes"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Sean K."},{"family":"Macklin","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Mindy"},{"family":"Pande","given":"Nilesh"},{"family":"Havari","given":"Evis"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Chomyk","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Christie","given":"Emilie"},{"family":"Trapp","given":"Bruce D."},{"family":"Ofengeim","given":"Dimitry"}],"citation-key":"gruberBTKRegulatesMicroglial2024","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-024-54430-8","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,22]]},"language":"en","page":"10116","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"BTK regulates microglial function and neuroinflammation in human stem cell models and mouse models of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54430-8","volume":"15"},{"id":"gruterPropionateExertsNeuroprotective2023","abstract":"In inflammatory neuropathies, oxidative stress results in neuronal and Schwann cell (SC) death promoting early neurodegeneration and clinical disability. Treatment with the short-chain fatty acid propionate showed a significant immunoregulatory and neuroprotective effect in multiple sclerosis patients. Similar effects have been described for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Therefore, Schwann cell’s survival and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) outgrowth were evaluated in vitro after propionate treatment and application of H2O2 or S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D-L-penicillamine (SNAP) to evaluate neuroprotection. In addition, DRG resistance was evaluated by the application of oxidative stress by SNAP ex vivo after in vivo propionate treatment. Propionate treatment secondary to SNAP application on DRG served as a neuroregeneration model. Histone acetylation as well as expression of the free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) 2 and 3, histone deacetylases, neuroregeneration markers, and antioxidative mediators were investigated. β-hydroxybutyrate was used as a second FFAR3 ligand, and pertussis toxin was used as an FFAR3 antagonist. FFAR3, but not FFAR2, expression was evident on SC and DRG. Propionate-mediated activation of FFAR3 and histone 3 hyperacetylation resulted in increased catalase expression and increased resistance to oxidative stress. In addition, propionate treatment resulted in enhanced neuroregeneration with concomitant growth-associated protein 43 expression. We were able to demonstrate an antioxidative and neuroregenerative effect of propionate on SC and DRG mediated by FFAR3-induced histone acetylases expression.

The upregulation of Th17 cells is critical in the pathological process of MS. Hederagenol (Hed) has been shown to lower IL‐17 levels, although its role in MS pathophysiology is uncertain. In this study, we explore whether Hed could ameliorate MS by modulating Th17 cell differentiation, with the goal of identifying new treatment targets for MS. The experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model was conducted and Hed was intraperitoneally injected into mice. The weight was recorded and the clinical symptom grade was assessed. Hematoxylin‐eosin staining was carried out to determine the extent of inflammation in the spinal cord and liver. The luxol Fast Blue staining was performed to detect the pathological changes in the myelin sheath. Nerve damage was detected using NeuN immunofluorescence staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling staining. Immunohistology approaches were used to study alterations in immune cells in the spinal cord. The proportions of T cell subsets in the spleens were analyzed by flow cytometry. RORγt levels were measured using quantitative real‐time PCR or Western blot. The activity of the RORγt promoter was analyzed by Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Hed administration reduced the clinical symptom grade of EAE mice, as well as the inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and cell disorder of the spinal cord, while having no discernible effect on the mouse weight.

Remyelination is the natural regenerating process after demyelination that also provides neuroprotection but is often incomplete or fails in MS. Currently available therapeutics are affecting the immune system, but there is no substance that might enhance remyelination. Cytidine-S-diphosphate choline (CDP-choline), a precursor of the biomembrane component phospholipid phosphatidylcholine was shown to improve remyelination in two animal models of demyelination. However, the doses used in previous animal studies were high (500 mg/kg), and it is not clear if lower doses, which could be applied in human trials, might exert the same beneficial effect on remyelination. The aim of this study was to confirm previous results and to determine the potential regenerative effects of lower doses of CDP-choline (100 and 50 mg/kg). The effects of CDP-choline were investigated in the toxic cuprizone-induced mouse model of de- and remyelination. We found that even low doses of CDP-choline effectively enhanced early remyelination. The beneficial effects on myelin regeneration were accompanied by higher numbers of oligodendrocytes. In conclusion, CDP-choline could become a promising regenerative substance for patients with multiple sclerosis and should be tested in a clinical trial.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gudi","given":"Viktoria"},{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Gingele","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Stangel","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Skripuletz","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"gudiRegenerativeEffectsCDPCholine2021","container-title":"Pharmaceuticals","container-title-short":"Pharmaceuticals","DOI":"10.3390/ph14111156","ISSN":"1424-8247","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,12]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1156","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Regenerative Effects of CDP-Choline: A Dose-Dependent Study in the Toxic Cuprizone Model of De- and Remyelination","title-short":"Regenerative Effects of CDP-Choline","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/14/11/1156","volume":"14"},{"id":"guDomainSpecificLanguageModel2022","abstract":"Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

In this paper, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly-available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition (NER).

Pharmacological inhibition of CSF‐1R leads to an almost complete microglial depletion whereas treatment arrest allows for subsequent repopulation. Microglial depletion has shown promising results in many animal models of neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis) where transitory microglial depletion reduced neuroinflammation and improved behavioral test results. In this review, we will focus on the comparison of three different pharmacological CSF‐1R inhibitors (PLX3397, PLX5622, and GW2580) regarding microglial depletion. We will also highlight the promising results obtained by microglial depletion strategies in adult models of neurological disorders and argue they could also prove promising in neurodevelopmental diseases associated with microglial activation and neuroinflammation.

People with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) experience chronic fatigue which is difficult to deal with therapeutically and greatly affects health-related quality of life (QOL). PwMS are aware of the lack of generalized dietary advice related to their disease, leading to self-experimentation with diet. It is necessary to provide objective information about dietary interventions for pwMS. We aim to provide an objective synthesis of the evidence for efficacy and safety of specific diets in pwMS through a rapid review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), examining symptomatic fatigue (MFIS), QOL, Expanded-Disability-Status-Scale (EDSS), and severe adverse events. Methods: We have carried out a rapid review (MEDLINE and EMBASE) up to December 2021, with PRISMA methodology, and meta-analyses, of (RCTs). All statistical analyses were performed using the comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) -RStudio 4.1.3. The analysis used weighted mean differences (WMD) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model to compare the effects of the dietary intervention with the control. Results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these eight studies, five analyzed EDSS, three MFIS, and three QOL. A total of 515 patients were analyzed. These meta-analyses cumulative evidence support that dietary intervention is associated with a trend of reduction in fatigue (308 patients studied) -the difference between means (SMD) of the control group and intervention group was -2,033, 95%-IC (-3,195, -0,152), a p-value of 0.0341)-, an increase in QOL (77 patients studied), no significant effect on EDSS (337 patients studied), and no severe adverse events. Conclusions: It is difficult to reach a high level of evidence in dietary studies. Our findings show that dietary intervention is associated with a trend of reduction in fatigue in MS. Taking into account the potential of dietary interventions and the benefit/risk ratio in their favor, neurologists must be aware of the great importance of making interventions on diet in MS if necessary. There are dietary interventions with some evidence of benefit for patients with MS, which could be chosen based on adherence, patient preferences, and individual outcomes. Large prospective clinical trials are needed to shed further light on this topic.","author":[{"literal":"Guerrero Aznar"},{"literal":"M D"},{"literal":"Villanueva Guerrero"},{"literal":"M D"},{"literal":"Cordero Ramos"},{"literal":"J"},{"literal":"Eichau Madueño"},{"literal":"S"},{"literal":"Morales Bravo"},{"literal":"M"},{"literal":"López Ruiz"},{"literal":"R"},{"literal":"Beltrán García"},{"literal":"M"}],"citation-key":"guerreroaznarEfficacyDietFatigue2022","container-title":"BMC Neurology","DOI":"10.1186/s12883-022-02913-w","ISSN":"1471-2377","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"title":"Efficacy of diet on fatigue, quality of life and disability status in multiple sclerosis patients: rapid review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-022-02913-w","volume":"22"},{"id":"guerrieroEffectsMediatedDimethyl2022","abstract":"Background: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a drug currently in use in oral therapy for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) due to its immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects.

Results: DMF has been observed to induce a slowdown of cell proliferation, favoring the oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs) differentiation. DMF has an antioxidant effect and is able to modify the lipid content even after the LPS-mediated inflammatory stimulus in Oli neu cells. Conclusions: The results obtained confirm that DMF has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects also on Oli neu cells. Interestingly, it appears to promote the OLCs differentiation towards mature and potentially myelinating cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Guerriero","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Puliatti","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Di Marino","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Tata","given":"Ada Maria"}],"citation-key":"guerrieroEffectsMediatedDimethyl2022","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms23073615","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,25]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"3615","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects Mediated by Dimethyl Fumarate on In Vitro Oligodendrocytes: Implications in Multiple Sclerosis","title-short":"Effects Mediated by Dimethyl Fumarate on In Vitro Oligodendrocytes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/7/3615","volume":"23"},{"id":"GuidanceBestPractices","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,9]]},"citation-key":"GuidanceBestPractices","title":"Guidance for best practices for clinical trials","type":"webpage","URL":"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/378782/9789240097711-eng.pdf?sequence=1"},{"id":"guimaraesHsp65producingLactococcusLactis2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Guimaraes","given":"Mauro A.F."},{"family":"Pinheiro-Rosa","given":"Natália"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Rafael P."},{"family":"Aguiar","given":"Sarah L.F."},{"family":"Miranda","given":"Mariana C.G."},{"family":"Lemos","given":"Luísa"},{"family":"Souza","given":"Adna L."},{"family":"Dos Reis","given":"Daniela S."},{"family":"Medeiros","given":"Samara R."},{"family":"Gonçalves","given":"William A."},{"family":"Amaral","given":"Sylvia S."},{"family":"Pinho","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Miyoshi","given":"Anderson"},{"family":"Azevedo","given":"Vasco A.Z."},{"family":"Rezende","given":"Rafael M."},{"family":"Faria","given":"Ana M.C."}],"citation-key":"guimaraesHsp65producingLactococcusLactis2023","container-title":"Cellular Immunology","container-title-short":"Cellular Immunology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cellimm.2022.104661","ISSN":"00088749","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"en","page":"104661","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hsp65-producing Lactococcus lactis inhibits experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by preventing cell migration into spinal cord","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0008874922001861","volume":"384"},{"id":"gulerFactorsDeterminingTreatment2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Guler","given":"Sibel"}],"citation-key":"gulerFactorsDeterminingTreatment2022","container-title":"Neurological Research","container-title-short":"Neurological Research","DOI":"10.1080/01616412.2021.1967680","ISSN":"0161-6412, 1743-1328","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"177-185","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Factors determining the treatment ineffectiveness in multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01616412.2021.1967680","volume":"44"},{"id":"guMiR99aRegulatesCD42021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gu","given":"Yuting"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Hongshuang"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Wanlin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bei"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Fengtao"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Yiji"},{"family":"He","given":"Shan"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Xiaonan"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Linqiao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yanyun"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Min"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Eryi"}],"citation-key":"guMiR99aRegulatesCD42021","container-title":"Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids","container-title-short":"Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids","DOI":"10.1016/j.omtn.2021.07.010","ISSN":"21622531","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1173-1185","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"miR-99a regulates CD4+ T cell differentiation and attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by mTOR-mediated glycolysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2162253121001785","volume":"26"},{"id":"gunaydinTofacitinibEnhancesRemyelination2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Günaydın","given":"Caner"},{"family":"Önger","given":"M.

However, over the past two decades, increasing evidence has highlighted the role of gray matter pathology in MS-related disability. Numerous studies have linked the presence of leptomeningeal inflammation to a more severe disease course, underscoring its potential importance as a driver of gray matter pathology in MS. The major components of leptomeningeal inflammation include T cells, B cells, macrophages, follicular dendritic cells, and plasma cells. Since BAFF [B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family] promotes B cell survival and maturation and is a co-stimulator of T cells, we used anti-BAFF antibody 10F4 as a BAFF antagonist to study its effect on meningeal inflammation and adjacent brain regions in a relapsing–remitting PLP-EAE (rr-EAE) model of multiple sclerosis in SJL/J mice. rr-EAE mice were treated either with anti-BAFF antibody 10F4 or with IgG control antibody. We performed ultra-high field (11.7 T) MRI to identify areas of meningeal inflammation and track them over time in both treatment groups. We also performed histopathological analysis in brain sections of these mice to study the effects of the BAFF antagonist on leptomeningeal inflammation, and hippocampal and cortical neurons and synapses. We observed that BAFF antagonist treatment reduced B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells in regions of meningeal inflammation. Additionally, we noted that BAFF treatment protected against EAE-induced synaptic and neuronal loss in the adjacent cortex and in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus likely due to its effects on meningeal inflammation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gupta","given":"Kanak"},{"family":"Kesharwani","given":"Ajay"},{"family":"Rua","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Saumitra Sen"},{"family":"Siu","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Jank","given":"Larissa"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Calabresi","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Bhargava","given":"Pavan"}],"citation-key":"guptaBAFFBlockadeExperimental2023","container-title":"Journal of Neuroinflammation","container-title-short":"J Neuroinflammation","DOI":"10.1186/s12974-023-02922-7","ISSN":"1742-2094","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,7]]},"language":"en","page":"229","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"BAFF blockade in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis reduces inflammation in the meninges and synaptic and neuronal loss in adjacent brain regions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-023-02922-7","volume":"20"},{"id":"gurskiAntiinflammatoryRemyelinatingEffects2025","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background and Purpose\n              \n                FGF, VEGFR‐2 and CSF1R signalling pathways play a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods: In this 12-week multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients received a single treatment of either BoNT-A 1,000-1,500 Ipsen units or placebo injected into the adductor muscles of each leg [500-750 Ipsen units per leg]. The primary outcome measure was a novel, patient-selected, functional outcome measure at week 4. Results: Fifty-five subjects were treated with BoNT-A, and 51 received the placebo. Treatment benefit in favor of BoNT-A, which tended toward significance, was seen for most endpoints but not the subjective patient-selected key outcome measure. As with a previous dose-ranging study of BoNT-A, pain was significantly reduced in both legs [P 0.05 at weeks 8 and 12]. Lack of significance for the other endpoints was probably due to the low number of patients who received the full 1,500 Ipsen unit dose of BoNT-A, which has previously been shown to be effective.

Currently, injection-site problems and unfavorable daily injection are the most common milestones in administration of GA. So that, the design of improved drug delivery systems with sustained release profile seem necessary and helpful in order to minimize GA adverse effects and improve patients’ compliance. In this study, we have manufactured a novel chitosan-PLGA (poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)) hydrogel-microparticles containing GA by double emulsion method. Hydrogel-microparticles’ properties including size, morphology and GA loading were investigated. In-vitro drug release was studied during 30 days. In vivo efficacy of GA-hydrogel-microparticles was evaluated in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an established animal model for MS. Pathological studies were performed through H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) staining of brain, spine, liver, skin and kidney tissues. Luxol fast blue staining of brain tissue was also done. The obtained results were applied for safety and efficacy evaluations. GA loading and Entrapment efficiency (EE %) of 60% and 95% were achieved, respectively. In- vitro release studies confirms a sustained release profile for GA-hydrogel-microparticles.

Pain is a typical symptom of central nervous system demyelination, affecting 63% of adults with MS. Recently, the role of non-pharmacological pain management in patients is growing because the non-pharmacological interventions are considered safe, affordable, easy, and accessible. However, to date, no systematic reviews or meta-analyses have comprehensively examined the therapeutic effects of the variety of non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions in the management of pain in patients with MS. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of the non-pharmacological rehabilitation interventions in pain management in patients with MS. METHODS: A comprehensive search using PubMed, Cochrane, and Science Direct databases was performed and included all randomized controlled trials, randomized cross-over trials, and quasi-experimental trials assessing the effect of non-pharmacological interventions for managing pain in patients with MS. This study was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines of a systematic review and pair-wise meta-analysis. Meta-analyses were performed by calculating the standardized mean difference at a 95% confidence interval using Review Manager software. RESULTS: Twenty-nine papers were included in the systematic review, and only 22 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis showed a significant effect of neuromodulation and transcranial direct current stimulation on pain intensity reduction in patients with MS (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.09, P = 0.02), (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.16 P = 0.01), respectively. The analysis showed significant improvement in pain intensity in patient with MS after mind-body therapies (SMD -0.45, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.7, P = 0.02), mindfulness (SMD -0.55, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.14, P = 0.009), hypnosis (SMD -0.88, 95% CI -1.30 to -0.46, P = 0.0001), trigger point therapies (SMD -0.83, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.01, P = 0.05) and cognitive behavioral therapy (SMD -0.64, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.11, P = 0.02).

As a result, most people with MS (PwMS) experience gait asymmetries between their legs leading to an increased risk of falls. Recent work indicates that split-belt treadmill adaptation, where the speed of each leg is controlled independently, can decrease gait asymmetries for other neurodegenerative impairments. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of split-belt treadmill training to improve gait symmetry in PwMS. In this study, 35 PwMS underwent a 10 min split-belt treadmill adaptation paradigm, with the faster paced belt moving under the more affected limb. Step length asymmetry (SLA) and phase coordination index (PCI) were the primary outcome measures used to assess spatial and temporal gait symmetries, respectively. It was predicted that participants with a worse baseline symmetry would have a greater response to split-belt treadmill adaptation. Following this adaptation paradigm, PwMS experienced aftereffects that improved gait symmetry, with a significant difference between predicted responders and nonresponders in both SLA and PCI change (p < 0.001). Additionally, there was no correlation between SLA and PCI change. These findings suggest that PwMS retain the ability for gait adaptation, with those most asymmetrical at baseline demonstrating the greatest improvement, and that there may be separate neural mechanisms for spatial and temporal locomotor adjustments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hagen","given":"Andrew C."},{"family":"Acosta","given":"Jordan S."},{"family":"Geltser","given":"Chaia S."},{"family":"Fling","given":"Brett W."}],"citation-key":"hagenSplitBeltTreadmillAdaptation2023","container-title":"Sensors","container-title-short":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s23125456","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,9]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"5456","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Split-Belt Treadmill Adaptation Improves Spatial and Temporal Gait Symmetry in People with Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5456","volume":"23"},{"id":"haghmoradBoneMarrowMesenchymal2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Haghmorad","given":"Dariush"},{"family":"Khaleghian","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Eslami","given":"Majid"},{"family":"Sadeghnejad","given":"Abdolvahid"},{"family":"Tarahomi","given":"Mahdieh"},{"family":"Yousefi","given":"Bahman"}],"citation-key":"haghmoradBoneMarrowMesenchymal2023","container-title":"Molecular Biology Reports","container-title-short":"Mol Biol Rep","DOI":"10.1007/s11033-023-08843-1","ISSN":"0301-4851, 1573-4978","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"language":"en","page":"9971-9984","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis via modifying expression patterns of miRNAs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11033-023-08843-1","volume":"50"},{"id":"haghmoradOralAdministrationMyelin2022","abstract":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS).

Female C57BL/6 mice were utilized in three groups (Control group, received PBS orally; prevention group, oral administration of MOG35–55 two weeks before EAE induction; treatment group, oral administration of MOG35–55 after EAE induction). MOG administration, both as prevention and treatment, significantly controlled clinical score, weight loss, CNS inflammation, and demyelination, mainly through the modulation of T cell proliferation, and reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors, including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-17, T-bet, and ROR-γt. MOG administration, both as prevention and treatment, also induced anti-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors, including IL-4, TGF-β, GATA-3, and Foxp3.

Immunomodulatory mechanisms include the induction of Th2 and Treg cells and the suppression of pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Haghmorad","given":"Dariush"},{"family":"Yousefi","given":"Bahman"},{"family":"Eslami","given":"Majid"},{"family":"Rashidy-Pour","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Tarahomi","given":"Mahdieh"},{"family":"Tavaf","given":"Maryam Jadid"},{"family":"Soltanmohammadi","given":"Azita"},{"family":"Zargarani","given":"Simin"},{"family":"Kamyshnyi","given":"Aleksandr"},{"family":"Oksenych","given":"Valentyn"}],"citation-key":"haghmoradOralAdministrationMyelin2022","container-title":"Current Issues in Molecular Biology","container-title-short":"CIMB","DOI":"10.3390/cimb44110388","ISSN":"1467-3045","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,18]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"5728-5740","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Oral Administration of Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Attenuates Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis through Induction of Th2/Treg Cells and Suppression of Th1/Th17 Immune Responses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/44/11/388","volume":"44"},{"id":"haidarTargetingLipophagyMacrophages2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Haidar","given":"Mansour"},{"family":"Loix","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Vanherle","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Dierckx","given":"Tess"},{"family":"Vangansewinkel","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Gervois","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Wolfs","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Lambrichts","given":"Ivo"},{"family":"Bogie","given":"Jeroen F.J."},{"family":"Hendriks","given":"Jerome J.A."}],"citation-key":"haidarTargetingLipophagyMacrophages2022","container-title":"Autophagy","container-title-short":"Autophagy","DOI":"10.1080/15548627.2022.2047343","ISSN":"1554-8627, 1554-8635","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,2]]},"language":"en","page":"2697-2710","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Targeting lipophagy in macrophages improves repair in multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15548627.2022.2047343","volume":"18"},{"id":"haindlVitaminDAnEffective2023","abstract":"Vitamin D (VD) is the most discussed antioxidant supplement for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and many studies suggest correlations between a low VD serum level and onset and progression of the disease. While many studies in animals as well as clinical studies focused on the role of VD in the relapsing-remitting MS, knowledge is rather sparse for the progressive phase of the disease and the development of cortical pathology. In this study, we used our established rat model of cortical inflammatory demyelination, resembling features seen in late progressive MS, to address the question about whether VD could have positive effects on reducing cortical pathology, oxidative stress, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) serum levels. For this purpose, we used male Dark Agouti (DA) rats, with one group being supplemented with VD (400 IE per week; VD+) from the weaning on at age three weeks; the other group received standard rodent food. The rat brains were assessed using immunohistochemical markers against demyelination, microglial activation, apoptosis, neurons, neurofilament, and reactive astrocytes. To evaluate the effect of VD on oxidative stress and the antioxidant capacity, we used two different oxidized lipid markers (anti- Cu++ and HOCl oxidized LDL antibodies) along with colorimetric methods for protective polyphenols (PP) and total antioxidative capacity (TAC). NfL serum levels of VD+ and VD− animals were analyzed by fourth generation single-molecule array (SIMOA) analysis. We found significant differences between the VD+ and VD− animals both in histopathology as well as in all serum markers. Myelin loss and microglial activation is lower in VD+ animals and the number of apoptotic cells is significantly reduced with a higher neuronal survival. VD+ animals show significantly lower NfL serum levels, a higher TAC, and more PP. Additionally, there is a significant reduction of oxidized lipid markers in animals under VD supplementation. Our data thus show a positive effect of VD on cellular features of cortical pathology in our animal model, presumably due to protection against reactive oxygen species. In this study, VD enhanced remyelination and prevented neuroaxonal and oxidative damage, such as demyelination and neurodegeneration. However, more studies on VD dose relations are required to establish an optimal response while avoiding overdosing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Haindl","given":"Michaela Tanja"},{"family":"Üçal","given":"Muammer"},{"family":"Wonisch","given":"Willibald"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Nowakowska","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Adzemovic","given":"Milena Z."},{"family":"Khalil","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Enzinger","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Hochmeister","given":"Sonja"}],"citation-key":"haindlVitaminDAnEffective2023","container-title":"Nutrients","container-title-short":"Nutrients","DOI":"10.3390/nu15153309","ISSN":"2072-6643","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,26]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"3309","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Vitamin D—An Effective Antioxidant in an Animal Model of Progressive Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/15/3309","volume":"15"},{"id":"hajimirzaeiSchwannCellTransplantation2025","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hajimirzaei","given":"Pooya"},{"family":"Tabatabaei","given":"Faeze Sadat Ahmadi"},{"family":"Nasibi-Sis","given":"Hamed"},{"family":"Razavian","given":"Reyhane Sadat"},{"family":"Nasirinezhad","given":"Farinaz"}],"citation-key":"hajimirzaeiSchwannCellTransplantation2025","container-title":"Experimental Neurology","container-title-short":"Experimental Neurology","DOI":"10.1016/j.expneurol.2024.115062","ISSN":"00144886","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2]]},"language":"en","page":"115062","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Schwann cell transplantation for remyelination, regeneration, tissue sparing, and functional recovery in spinal cord injury: A systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies","title-short":"Schwann cell transplantation for remyelination, regeneration, tissue sparing, and functional recovery in spinal cord injury","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014488624003881","volume":"384"},{"id":"hajizadehModulatoryEffectsHydatid2024","abstract":"The reduced burden of helminth parasites in industrialized countries is probably one of the reasons for the increased prevalence of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS).

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplements on MS-related relapse and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). METHODS: We searched databases to include randomized clinical trials (RCTs) which were published up to October 2018. We included RCTs, being single-blinded or double-blinded or open-label trials in which one of the main outcomes was EDSS and/or relapse after vitamin D supplementation. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for relapse between treatment arms. The mean difference was calculated for EDSS comparisons. RESULTS: Nine articles were included for analysis. Of these nine studies, five compared vitamin D supplement groups with placebo (group 1 studies), and four compared high- and low-dose vitamin D groups. A total of 561 patients were analyzed. Being treated with vitamin D instead of placebo showed no effect on relapse rate (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.28-1.54) as well as EDSS (mean difference = 0.06, 95%CI [-0.31, 0.42]). The results of studies comparing high- vs. low-dose vitamin D interventions showed no significant effect on relapse rate (OR = 1.08, 95%CI [0.29-4.08] as well as final EDSS (mean difference = 0.17, 95% CI = -0.73, 1.07).

We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the potential causal effects of T2D and glycemic traits, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting glucose (FG), fasting insulin (FI), and 2-hour glucose (2h-glu), on risk of dementia subtypes, stroke subtypes, and structural brain changes.Methods We conducted a two-sample MR analysis using summary statistics from large genome-wide association studies in European populations. Outcomes included all-cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), ischemic stroke, lacunar stroke, and five MRI-derived brain phenotypes (total brain volume, total white and grey matter volumes, hippocampal volume, and white matter hyperintensities (WMH)). The inverse-variance weighted method was the primary analysis; MR-Egger, weighted median, and Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) were used for sensitivity analyses.Multivariable MR adjusted for body mass index (BMI).Results Genetic liability to higher HbA1c was associated with increased AD risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.08-1.68) and lower hippocampal volume (β =-0.489, SE = 0.152). T2D was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.11-1.17), lacunar stroke (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.09-1.21), and lower grey matter volume (β =-0.032, SE = 0.011). FG, FI, and 2h-glu were also associated with stroke subtypes. These associations persisted after BMI adjustment. No consistent associations were observed with VaD or WMH.Conclusions/interpretation This study provides genetic evidence that HbA1c may causally contribute to AD and regional brain atrophy, while T2D and other glycemic traits are primarily linked to stroke risk. Incorporating brain MRI outcomes provides insight into distinct vascular and neurodegenerative pathways linking dysglycemia to brain health.What is already known about this subject?Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hyperglycemia have been associated with increased risk of dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD), in observational studies.Observational designs are prone to confounding and reverse causality, limiting causal inference.Previous Mendelian randomization (MR) studies on glycemic traits and dementia risk have produced inconsistent results and rarely examined brain structural changes as intermediate outcomes.What is the key question?Do genetically predicted T2D and glycemic traits (hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, 2-hour glucose) causally influence dementia risk, stroke subtypes, and neuroimaging biomarkers of brain structure?What are the new findings?Genetically predicted higher HbA1c levels were associated with increased risk of AD and with reductions in hippocampal and white matter volumes.T2D and other glycemic traits showed stronger associations with ischemic and small vessel stroke, suggesting vascular mechanisms.This study combines clinical and imaging outcomes to distinguish neurodegenerative from cerebrovascular pathways in diabetes-related brain changes.How might this impact clinical practice in the foreseeable future?The findings underscore the importance of optimizing long-term glycemic control even before the onset of T2D to reduce the risk of neurodegenerative and vascular brain pathology in individuals with diabetes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementS.H. is supported by a scholarship from the China Scholarship Council (CSC) under Grant No. 202208330062. by the China Scholarship Council Program (No. 202208330062).

We aimed to investigate the effect of CBM on NP and spasticity in patients with MS or SCI. We performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in Denmark. Patients aged ≥18 years with NP (intensity >3, ≤9 on a numerical rating scale (NRS0-10) and/or spasticity (>3 on NRS0-10) were randomized to treatment consisting of either delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), a combination of THC&CBD in maximum doses of 22.5 mg, 45 mg and 22.5/45 mg per day, respectively, or placebo. A baseline registration was performed before randomization. Treatment duration was six weeks followed by a one-week phaseout. Primary endpoints were the intensity of patient-reported NP and/or spasticity. Between February 2019 and December 2021, 134 patients were randomized (MS n = 119, SCI n = 15), where 32 were assigned to THC, 31 to CBD, 31 to THC&CBD, and 40 to placebo.

The remyelination failure and neurodegeneration results in permanent clinical disability in MS patients. A desirable therapy should not only modulate the immune system, but also promote neuroprotection and remyelination. To investigate the neuroprotective effect of CD52 antibody in MS, both C57BL/6J and SJL mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) were treated with CD52 antibody at the peak of disease. Treatment with CD52 antibody depleted T but not B lymphocytes in the blood, reduced the infiltration of T lymphocytes and microglia/macrophages in the spinal cord. Anti-CD52 therapy attenuated EAE scores during the recovery phase. It protected neurons immediately after treatment (within 4 days) as shown by reducing the accumulation of amyloid precursor proteins. It potentially promoted remyelination as it increased the number of olig2/CC-1-positive mature oligodendrocytes and prevented myelin loss in the following days (e.g., 14 days post treatment). In further experiments, EAE mice with a conditional knockout of BDNF in neurons were administered with CD52 antibodies. Neuronal deficiency of BDNF attenuated the effect of anti-CD52 treatment on reducing EAE scores and inflammatory infiltration but did not affect anti-CD52 treatment-induced improvement of myelin coverage in the spinal cord. In summary, anti-CD52 therapy depletes CD4-positive T lymphocytes, prevents myelin loss and protects neurons in EAE mice. Neuronal BDNF regulates neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect of CD52 antibody in EAE mice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hao","given":"Wenlin"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Menger","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Fassbender","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yang"}],"citation-key":"haoTreatmentCD52Antibody2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Immunology","container-title-short":"Front.

Their development is tightly regulated by distinct spatial and temporal cues during embryogenesis and into adulthood throughout the CNS. Astrocytes have several important responsibilities such as regulating blood flow and permeability of the blood‐CNS barrier, glucose metabolism and storage, synapse formation and function, and axon myelination. In CNS pathologies, astrocytes also play critical parts in both injury and repair mechanisms. Upon injury, they undergo a robust phenotypic shift known as “reactive astrogliosis,” which results in both constructive and deleterious outcomes. Astrocyte activation and migration at the site of injury provides an early defense mechanism to minimize the extent of injury by enveloping the lesion area. However, astrogliosis also contributes to the inhibitory microenvironment of CNS injury and potentiate secondary injury mechanisms, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity, which facilitate neurodegeneration in CNS pathologies. Intriguingly, reactive astrocytes are increasingly a focus in current therapeutic strategies as their activation can be modulated toward a neuroprotective and reparative phenotype. This review will discuss recent advancements in knowledge regarding the development and role of astrocytes in the healthy and pathological CNS. We will also review how astrocytes have been genetically modified to optimize their reparative potential after injury, and how they may be transdifferentiated into neurons and oligodendrocytes to promote repair after CNS injury and neurodegeneration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hart","given":"Christopher G."},{"family":"Karimi‐Abdolrezaee","given":"Soheila"}],"citation-key":"hartRecentInsightsAstrocyte2021","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience Research","container-title-short":"J of Neuroscience Research","DOI":"10.1002/jnr.24922","ISSN":"0360-4012, 1097-4547","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"language":"en","page":"2427-2462","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recent insights on astrocyte mechanisms in CNS homeostasis, pathology, and repair","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24922","volume":"99"},{"id":"hartungEfficacySafetyTemelimab2022","abstract":"Background:\n              The envelope protein of human endogenous retrovirus W (HERV-W-Env) is expressed by macrophages and microglia, mediating axonal damage in chronic active MS lesions.\n            \n            \n              Objective and Methods:\n              This phase 2, double-blind, 48-week trial in relapsing-remitting MS with 48-week extension phase assessed the efficacy and safety of temelimab; a monoclonal antibody neutralizing HERV-W-Env.

In this study, we have conducted a large meta-analysis of DNA methylation across multiple cortical brain regions, in relation to increasing burden of LB pathology. Utilizing a combined dataset of 1239 samples across 855 unique donors, we identified a set of 30 false discovery rate (FDR) significant loci that are differentially methylated in association with LB pathology, the most significant of which were located in UBASH3B and PTAFR, as well as an intergenic locus. Ontological enrichment analysis of our meta-analysis results highlights several neurologically relevant traits, including synaptic, inflammatory and vascular alterations. We leverage our summary statistics to compare DNA methylation signatures between different neurodegenerative pathologies and highlight a shared epigenetic profile across LB diseases, Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease, although the top-ranked loci show disease specificity. Finally, utilizing summary statistics from previous large-scale genome-wide association studies we report FDR significant enrichment of DNA methylation differences with respect to increasing LB pathology in the SNCA genomic region, a gene previously associated with Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was funded by research grants from the Medical Research Council (MRC (MR/S011625/1), the National Institute of Aging (NIA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (R01AG067015), the Alzheimer's Society (AS-PG-16b-012), Alzheimer's Research UK (ARUK-PG2023A-037) and the Charles Wolfson Charitable Trust to KL, research grants from the Michael J Fox Foundation (MJFF-023152) and ZonMw Memorabel/Alzheimer Nederland Grant (733050516) to EP and a research fellowship from the Alzheimer's Society (AS-PDF-23-017) to JI.

In most patients, the disease starts with an acute onset followed by a remission phase, subsequent relapses and a later transition to steady chronic progression. In a minority of patients, this progressive phase develops from the beginning. MS relapses are characterized predominantly by the de novo formation of an inflammatory CNS lesion and the infiltration of immune cells, whereas the pathological features of MS progression include slowly expanding lesions, global brain atrophy and an inflammatory response predominantly mediated by macrophages/microglia. Importantly, this CNS-intrinsic pathophysiology appears to initiate early during the relapsing–remitting disease phase, while it turns into the key clinical MS feature in later stages. Currently approved disease-modifying treatments for MS are effective in modulating peripheral immunity by dampening immune cell activity or preventing the migration of immune cells into the CNS, resulting in the prevention of relapses; however, they show limited success in halting MS progression. In this manuscript, we first describe the pathological mechanisms of MS and summarize the approved therapeutics for MS progression. We also review the treatment options for progressive MS (PMS) that are currently under investigation.

Patients with MS (PwMS) have looked for alternative therapies to control their MS progress and treat their symptoms. Non-invasive therapeutic approaches such as massage can have benefits to mitigate some of these symptoms. However, there is no rigorous review of massage effectiveness for PwMS. The present systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of different massage approaches on common MS symptoms, including fatigue, pain, anxiety, depression, and spasticity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of related trials was conducted in electronic databases including Cochrane Library, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, using search terms related to Multiple Sclerosis and massage therapy. The PEDro scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of reviewed studies. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. We rated 5 studies as fair and 7 studies as good. Fatigue was improved by different massage styles, such as reflexology, nonspecific therapeutic massage, and Swedish massage. Pain, anxiety, and depression were effectively improved by reflexology techniques. Spasticity was reduced by Swedish massage and reflexology techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Different massage approaches effectively improved MS symptoms such as fatigue, pain, anxiety, depression, and spasticity.Implications for rehabilitationThe present review results indicate that massage may have beneficial effects on motor and non-motor symptoms in MS.Massage could be considered a complementary and alternative treatment combined with conventional medicine in people with MS.Pain and fatigue are best improved by Swedish massage, while anxiety and depression are effectively improved by reflexology.","author":[{"literal":"Heidari Z"},{"literal":"Shahrbanian S"},{"literal":"Chiu C"}],"citation-key":"heidarizMassageTherapyComplementary2021","container-title":"Disabil Rehabil","DOI":"10.1080/09638288.2021.1949051","ISSN":"0963-8288","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"1-12","title":"Massage therapy as a complementary and alternative approach for people with multiple sclerosis: a systematic review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2021.1949051"},{"id":"henneganInhibition7a26dihydroxycholesterolBiosynthesis2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hennegan","given":"James"},{"family":"Bryant","given":"Aled H."},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Trigano","given":"Matthieu"},{"family":"Bartley","given":"Oliver J.M."},{"family":"Bartlett","given":"Joanna J."},{"family":"Minahan","given":"Carys"},{"family":"Abreu De Oliveira","given":"Willy Antoni"},{"family":"Yutuc","given":"Eylan"},{"family":"Ntikas","given":"Sotirios"},{"family":"Bartsocas","given":"Christos S."},{"family":"Markouri","given":"Margarita"},{"family":"Antoniadou","given":"Eleni"},{"family":"Laina","given":"Ioanna"},{"family":"Howell","given":"Owain W."},{"family":"Li","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuqin"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"William J."},{"family":"Lane","given":"Emma L."},{"family":"Lelos","given":"Mariah J."},{"family":"Theofilopoulos","given":"Spyridon"}],"citation-key":"henneganInhibition7a26dihydroxycholesterolBiosynthesis2024","container-title":"iScience","container-title-short":"iScience","DOI":"10.1016/j.isci.2023.108670","ISSN":"25890042","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","page":"108670","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Inhibition of 7α,26-dihydroxycholesterol biosynthesis promotes midbrain dopaminergic neuron development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589004223027475","volume":"27"},{"id":"henrietMonitoringRecoveryCNS2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            In multiple sclerosis, while remarkable progress has been accomplished to control the inflammatory component of the disease, repair of demyelinated lesions is still an unmet need. Despite encouraging results generated in experimental models, several candidates favouring or promoting remyelination have not reached the expected outcomes in clinical trials. One possible reason for these failures is that, in most cases, during preclinical testing, efficacy was evaluated on histology only, while functional recovery had not been assessed.\n            We have generated a Xenopus laevis transgenic model Tg(mbp:GFP-NTR) of conditional demyelination in which spontaneous remyelination can be accelerated using candidate molecules. Xenopus laevis is a classic model for in vivo studies of myelination because tadpoles are translucent. We reasoned that demyelination should translate into loss of sensorimotor functions followed by behavioural recovery upon remyelination. To this end, we measured the swimming speed and distance travelled before and after demyelination and during the ongoing spontaneous remyelination and have developed a functional assay based on the visual avoidance of a virtual collision.\n            Here we show that alteration of these functional and clinical performances correlated well with the level of demyelination and that histological remyelination, assayed by counting in vivo the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes in the optic nerve, translated in clinical–functional recovery. This method was further validated in tadpoles treated with pro-remyelinating agents (clemastine, siponimod) showing that increased remyelination in the optic nerve was associated with functional improvement.\n            Our data illustrate the potential interest of correlating histopathological parameters and functional–clinical parameters to screen molecules promoting remyelination in a simple in vivo model of conditional demyelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Henriet","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Elodie M"},{"family":"Jubin","given":"Pauline"},{"family":"Langui","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Mannioui","given":"Abdelkrim"},{"family":"Stankoff","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Lubetzki","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Khakhalin","given":"Arseny"},{"family":"Zalc","given":"Bernard"}],"citation-key":"henrietMonitoringRecoveryCNS2023","container-title":"Brain","DOI":"10.1093/brain/awad051","ISSN":"0006-8950, 1460-2156","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","page":"2453-2463","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Monitoring recovery after CNS demyelination, a novel tool to de-risk pro-remyelinating strategies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/146/6/2453/7095622","volume":"146"},{"id":"hermannExtracellularVesiclesSet2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are extremely versatile naturally occurring membrane particles that convey complex signals between cells. EVs of different cellular sources are capable of inducing striking therapeutic responses in neurological disease models. Differently from pharmacological compounds that act by modulating defined signalling pathways, EV-based therapeutics possess multiple abilities via a variety of effectors, thus allowing the modulation of complex disease processes that may have very potent effects on brain tissue recovery. When applied in vivo in experimental models of neurological diseases, EV-based therapeutics have revealed remarkable effects on immune responses, cell metabolism and neuronal plasticity. This multimodal modulation of neuroimmune networks by EVs profoundly influences disease processes in a highly synergistic and context-dependent way. Ultimately, the EV-mediated restoration of cellular functions helps to set the stage for neurological recovery.\n            With this review we first outline the current understanding of the mechanisms of action of EVs, describing how EVs released from various cellular sources identify their cellular targets and convey signals to recipient cells. Then, mechanisms of action applicable to key neurological conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases are presented. Pathways that deserve attention in specific disease contexts are discussed. We subsequently showcase considerations about EV biodistribution and delineate genetic engineering strategies aiming at enhancing brain uptake and signalling.\n            By sketching a broad view of EV-orchestrated brain plasticity and recovery, we finally define possible future clinical EV applications and propose necessary information to be provided ahead of clinical trials.

The efficiency of this mechanism depends however on the time needed for axons to regrow. Here, we show that ablation of histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) in SCs accelerates the regrowth of sensory axons and sensory function recovery. We found that HDAC8 is specifically expressed in sensory SCs and regulates the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF7, which destabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) and counteracts the phosphorylation and upregulation of c-Jun, a major inducer of the repair SC phenotype. Our study indicates that this phenotype switch is regulated by different mechanisms in sensory and motor SCs and is accelerated by HDAC8 downregulation, which promotes sensory axon regeneration and sensory function recovery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hertzog","given":"Nadège"},{"family":"Duman","given":"Mert"},{"family":"Bochud","given":"Maëlle"},{"family":"Brügger-Verdon","given":"Valérie"},{"family":"Gerhards","given":"Maren"},{"family":"Schön","given":"Felicia"},{"family":"Dorndecker","given":"Franka"},{"family":"Meijer","given":"Dies"},{"family":"Fledrich","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Stassart","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Sankar","given":"Devanarayanan Siva"},{"family":"Dengjel","given":"Jörn"},{"family":"López","given":"Sofía Raigón"},{"family":"Jacob","given":"Claire"}],"citation-key":"hertzogHypoxiainducedConversionSensory2025","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-025-55835-9","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,9]]},"language":"en","page":"515","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hypoxia-induced conversion of sensory Schwann cells into repair cells is regulated by HDAC8","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-55835-9","volume":"16"},{"id":"herzogsSystematicReviewCosts2018","abstract":"Introduction: Cannabis-based medicines (CBMs) may offer relief from symptoms of disease; however, their additional cost needs to be considered alongside their effectiveness. We sought to review the economic costs and benefits of prescribed CBMs in any chronic illness, and the frameworks used for their economic evaluation. Methods: A systematic review of eight medical and economic databases, from inception to mid-December 2016, was undertaken. MeSH headings and text words relating to economic costs and benefits, and CBMs were combined. Study quality was assessed using relevant checklists and results were synthesised in narrative form. Results: Of 2514 identified records, ten studies met the eligibility criteria, all for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS). Six contained economic evaluations, four studies reported utility-based quality of life, and one was a willingness-to-pay study. Four of five industry-sponsored cost–utility analyses for MS spasticity reported nabiximols as being cost-effective from a European health system perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for these five studies were £49,257 (UK); £10,891 (Wales); €11,214 (Germany); €4968 (Italy); and dominant (Spain). Nabiximols for the management of MS spasticity was not associated with statistically significant improvements in EQ-5D scores compared with standard care. Study quality was moderate overall, with limited inclusion of both relevant societal costs and discussions of potential bias. Conclusions: Prescribed CBMs are a potentially cost-effective add-on treatment for MS spasticity; however, this evidence is uncertain. Further investment in randomised trials with in-built economic evaluations is warranted for a wider range of clinical indications.

MS is known for its autoimmune-mediated damage to myelin, axonal injury, and neuronal loss which drive disability accumulation and disease progression, often manifesting as cognitive impairments. Understanding the involvement of neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the remediation of MS through adult neurogenesis (ANG) and gliogenesis—the generation of new neurons and glial cells, respectively is of great importance. Hence, these phenomena, respectively, termed ANG and gliogenesis, involve significant structural and functional changes in neural networks. Thus, the proper integration of these newly generated cells into existing circuits is not only key to understanding the CNS’s development but also its remodeling in adulthood and recovery from diseases such as MS. Understanding how MS influences the fate of NSCs/NPCs and their possible neuroprotective role, provides insights into potential therapeutic interventions to alleviate the impact of MS on cognitive function and disease progression. This review explores MS, its pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and its association with ANG and gliogenesis. It highlights the impact of altered NSCs and NPCs’ fate during MS and delves into the potential benefits of its modifications. It also evaluates treatment regimens that influence the fate of NSCS/NPCs to counteract the pathology subsequently.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hijal","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Fouani","given":"Malak"},{"family":"Awada","given":"Bassel"}],"citation-key":"hijalUnveilingFatePotential2024","container-title":"Frontiers in Neurology","container-title-short":"Front.

This phase I first‐in‐human healthy participant study (NCT05795907) was comprised of three parts: randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled single ascending dose (SAD; part 1a); 14‐day multiple ascending dose (MAD; part 2) parts that evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of SAR443820; and a separate open‐label, single‐dose part 1b (PK‐cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) to assess SAR443820 levels in CSF. SAR443820 was well‐tolerated in healthy participants, and no treatment discontinuation related to an adverse event (AE) occurred. Most common AEs were dizziness and headache. No clinically meaningful changes were noted in laboratory values, vital signs, or electrocardiogram parameters. SAR443820 had a favorable PK profile, with plasma half‐lives (geometric mean) ranged between 5.7–8.0 h and 7.2–8.9 h after single and repeated doses, respectively. There were no major deviations from dose proportionality for maximum concentration and area under the curve across SAR443820 doses. Mean CSF‐to‐unbound plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0.8 to 1.3 over time (assessed up to 10 h postdose), indicating high brain penetrance. High levels of inhibition of activated RIPK1, as measured by decrease in pS166‐RIPK1, were achieved in both SAD and MAD parts, with a maximum median inhibition from baseline close to 90% at predose (C\n              trough\n              ) after multiple dosing in MAD, reflecting a marked RIPK1 target engagement at the peripheral level.

Inflammation promotes the release of neurotrophic molecules and stimulates intrinsic proregenerative molecular machinery in neurons, but the detailed mechanisms driving this effect are not fully understood. We evaluated how microRNAs are regulated in retinal neurons in response to intraocular inflammation to identify their potential role in axon regeneration. We found that miR-383-5p is downregulated in retinal ganglion cells in response to zymosan-induced intraocular inflammation. MiR-383-5p downregulation in neurons is sufficient to promote axon growth in vitro, and the intravitreal injection of a miR-383-5p inhibitor into the eye promotes axon regeneration following optic nerve crush. MiR-383-5p directly targets ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor components, and miR-383-5p inhibition sensitizes adult retinal neurons to the outgrowth-promoting effects of CNTF. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that CNTF treatment is sufficient to reduce miR-383-5p levels in neurons, constituting a positive-feedback module, whereby initial CNTF treatment reduces miR-383-5p levels, which then disinhibits CNTF receptor components to sensitize neurons to the ligand. Additionally, miR-383-5p inhibition derepresses the mitochondrial antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin-3 (PRDX3) which was required for the proregenerative effects associated with miR-383-5p loss-of-function in vitro. We have thus identified a positive-feedback mechanism that facilitates neuronal CNTF sensitivity in neurons and a new molecular signaling module that promotes inflammation-induced axon regeneration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hintermayer","given":"Matthew A."},{"family":"Juźwik","given":"Camille A."},{"family":"Morquette","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Hua","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Drake","given":"Sienna"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Shan Shan"},{"family":"Rambaldi","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Vangoor","given":"Vamshi"},{"family":"Pasterkamp","given":"Jeroen"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Fournier","given":"Alyson E."}],"citation-key":"hintermayerMiR3835pSignalingHub2024","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

In the present study, we applied high-field MR imaging in locally-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice to evaluate dynamic changes following treatment with a humanized anti-repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) antibody, a potential drug for MS. Based on the longitudinal evaluation of various MRI parameters including white matter, axon, and myelin integrity as well as blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption, anti-RGMa antibody treatment exhibited a strong and prompt therapeutic effect on the disrupted BSCB, which was paralleled by functional improvement. The antibody’s effect on BSCB repair was also suggested\n              via\n              GeneChip analysis. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that EAE-induced vascular pathology which is characterized by aberrant thickening of endothelial cells and perivascular type I/IV collagen deposits were attenuated by anti-RGMa antibody treatment, further supporting the idea that the BSCB is one of the key therapeutic targets of anti-RGMa antibody. Importantly, the extent of BSCB disruption detected by MRI could predict late-phase demyelination, and the predictability of myelin integrity based on the extent of acute-phase BSCB disruption was compromised following anti-RGMa antibody treatment. These results strongly support the concept that longitudinal MRI with simultaneous DCE-MRI and DTI analysis can be used as an imaging biomarker and is useful for unbiased prioritization of the key biological process that mediates the therapeutic effect of tested drugs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirata","given":"Takeshi"},{"family":"Itokazu","given":"Takahide"},{"family":"Sasaki","given":"Atsushi"},{"family":"Sugihara","given":"Fuminori"},{"family":"Yamashita","given":"Toshihide"}],"citation-key":"hirataHumanizedAntiRGMaAntibody2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Immunology","container-title-short":"Front.

It was launched as TheFacebook in 2004, and renamed Facebook in 2005.\nFounded by Mark Zuckerberg and his college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes at Harvard University, it was initially limited to Harvard students. It expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and gradually most universities in the United States and Canada, corporations, and by 2006 to everyone with a valid email address along with an age requirement of being 13 or older. Facebook introduced key features like the News Feed in 2006, which became central to user engagement. By 2007, Facebook surpassed MySpace in global traffic and became the world's most popular social media platform. The company focused on generating revenue through targeted advertising based on user data, a model that drove its rapid financial growth. In 2012, Facebook went public with one of the largest IPOs in tech history. Acquisitions played a significant role in Facebook's dominance. In 2012, it purchased Instagram, followed by WhatsApp and Oculus VR in 2014, extending its influence beyond social networking into messaging and virtual reality. These moves helped Facebook maintain its position as a leader in the tech industry.\nDespite its success, Facebook has faced significant controversies. Privacy concerns surfaced early, including criticism of its data collection practices. The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018 revealed misuse of user data to influence elections, sparking global outcry and leading to regulatory fines and hearings. Facebook has been accused of enabling the spread of misinformation and hate speech and influencing political outcomes, prompting debates about content moderation and social media's role in society. The platform has frequently updated its algorithms to balance user experience with engagement-driven revenue, but these changes have sometimes drawn criticism for amplifying divisive content. Facebook's role in global events, including its use in organizing movements like the Arab Spring and, controversially, its impact on events like the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar, highlights its dual nature as a tool for empowerment and harm.\nIn 2021, Facebook rebranded as Meta, reflecting its shift toward building the \"metaverse\" and focusing on virtual reality and augmented reality technologies. Facebook continues to shape digital communication, commerce, and culture worldwide, with billions of users making it a key organisation in the 21st century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,3]]},"citation-key":"HistoryFacebook2025","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,22]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1286871736","source":"Wikipedia","title":"History of Facebook","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Facebook&oldid=1286871736"},{"id":"hoffmannNanoscaleModelSystem2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoffmann","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Haselberger","given":"David"},{"family":"Hofmann","given":"Tommy"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Janson","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Meister","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Das","given":"Manabendra"},{"family":"Vargas","given":"Carolyn"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Sandro"},{"family":"Kastritis","given":"Panagiotis L."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Hinderberger","given":"Dariush"}],"citation-key":"hoffmannNanoscaleModelSystem2021","container-title":"Biomacromolecules","container-title-short":"Biomacromolecules","DOI":"10.1021/acs.biomac.1c00714","ISSN":"1525-7797, 1526-4602","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"language":"en","license":"https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029","page":"3901-3912","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Nanoscale Model System for the Human Myelin Sheath","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c00714","volume":"22"},{"id":"hofMeasuringPredictingEffect2024","abstract":"Introduction\n              Remyelination failure hampers symptomatic recovery in multiple sclerosis (MS), underlining the importance of developing remyelinating therapies. Optic neuritis is currently the most established method of measuring remyelination in MS trials. Complementary more generalisable methods of measuring remyelination are required to confirm treatment efficacy. Measuring internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) with infrared oculography provides such a method. Moreover, this method can be expanded with a test for selecting likely treatment responders by using fampridine. The aim of this trial is to investigate the (long-term) remyelinating effects of clemastine fumarate in patients with MS and INO and to evaluate if treatment response can be predicted using fampridine.\n            \n            \n              Methods and analysis\n              RESTORE is a single-centre double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial of clemastine fumarate versus placebo.

Eighty individuals with MS and INO will be 1:1 randomised to 4 mg of clemastine fumarate two times a day for 6 months or equivalent placebo. Our primary outcome is improvement in the Versional Dysconjugacy Index-area under the curve, measured by infrared oculography after 6 months of treatment.

ATF3 was first implicated in the transcriptional reaction to axotomy when its massive upregulation was measured in sensory and motor neuron cell bodies following peripheral nerve injury. It has since been shown to be critical for successful axon regeneration in the peripheral nervous system and a promising target to mitigate regenerative failure in the central nervous system. However, much of the research to date has focused on ATF3’s function in neurons, leaving the expression, function, and therapeutic potential of ATF3 in glia largely unexplored. In the immunology literature ATF3 is seen as a master regulator of the innate immune system. Specifically, in macrophages following pathogen or damage associated molecular pattern receptor activation and subsequent cytokine release, ATF3 upregulation abrogates the inflammatory response. Importantly, ATF3 upregulation is not exclusively due to cellular stress exposure but has been achieved by the administration of several small molecules. In the central nervous system, microglia represent the resident macrophage population and are therefore of immediate interest with respect to ATF3 induction. It is our perspective that the potential of inducing ATF3 expression to dampen inflammatory microglial phenotype represents an unexplored therapeutic target and may have synergistic benefits when paired with concomitant neuronal ATF3 upregulation. This would be of particular benefit in pathologies that involve both detrimental inflammation and neuronal damage including spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Holland","given":"Seth D."},{"family":"Ramer","given":"Matt S."}],"citation-key":"hollandMicroglialActivatingTranscription2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels are widely expressed, play an important role as environmental sensors, and are involved in calcium homeostasis for a variety of cells. TRPV4 modulates myeloid cell phagocytosis in the periphery and microglial motility in the central nervous system. We hypothesized that TRPV4 deletion would alter microglia phagocytosis in vitro and lessen disease activity and demyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) and cuprizone-induced demyelination. We found that genetic deletion of TRPV4 led to increased microglial phagocytosis in vitro but did not alter the degree of demyelination or remyelination in the cuprizone mouse model of MS. We also found no difference in disease in EAE following global or microglia-specific deletion of Trpv4. Additionally, lesioned and normal appearing white matter from MS brains exhibited similar TRPV4 expression compared to healthy brain tissue. Taken together, these findings indicate that TRPV4 modulates microglial activity but does not impact disease activity in mouse models of MS, suggesting a muted and/or redundant role in MS pathogenesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Holloman","given":"Jameson P."},{"family":"Dimas","given":"Sophia H."},{"family":"Archambault","given":"Angela S."},{"family":"Filipello","given":"Fabia"},{"family":"Du","given":"Lixia"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yonghui"},{"family":"Bollman","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Piccio","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Steelman","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Hu","given":"Hongzhen"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Gregory F."}],"citation-key":"hollomanTransientReceptorPotential2023","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms242317097","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,4]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"17097","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4-Dependent Microglial Function in Myelin Injury and Repair","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/23/17097","volume":"24"},{"id":"holmClinicalAdvancesRNA2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Holm","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Stine N."},{"family":"Klitgaard","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Kauppinen","given":"Sakari"}],"citation-key":"holmClinicalAdvancesRNA2022","container-title":"RNA Biology","container-title-short":"RNA Biology","DOI":"10.1080/15476286.2022.2066334","ISSN":"1547-6286, 1555-8584","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,31]]},"language":"en","page":"594-608","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Clinical advances of RNA therapeutics for treatment of neurological and neuromuscular diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15476286.2022.2066334","volume":"19"},{"id":"honarvarUrsolicAcidEnhances2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Honarvar","given":"Fatemeh"},{"family":"Hojati","given":"Vida"},{"family":"Zare","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Bakhtiari","given":"Nuredin"},{"family":"Javan","given":"Mohammad"}],"citation-key":"honarvarUrsolicAcidEnhances2022","container-title":"Journal of Molecular Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J Mol Neurosci","DOI":"10.1007/s12031-022-02059-x","ISSN":"0895-8696, 1559-1166","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10]]},"language":"en","page":"2081-2093","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ursolic Acid Enhances Myelin Repair in Adult Mice Brains and Stimulates Exhausted Oligodendrocyte Progenitors to Remyelinate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-022-02059-x","volume":"72"},{"id":"hongKir41ChannelActivation2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hong","given":"Xiaoqi"},{"family":"Jian","given":"Yujin"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Shenghao"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Jianpo"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Xiaoli"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Huimin"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Butian"},{"family":"Zhuang","given":"Canbin"},{"family":"Wan","given":"Jieqing"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Xiaoping"}],"citation-key":"hongKir41ChannelActivation2023","container-title":"eBioMedicine","container-title-short":"eBioMedicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.104406","ISSN":"23523964","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","page":"104406","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Kir4.1 channel activation in NG2 glia contributes to remyelination in ischemic stroke","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352396422005886","volume":"87"},{"id":"hongPotentialTherapeuticEffects2022","abstract":"Sinomenine is a natural compound extracted from the medicinal plant Sinomenium acutum. Its supplementation has been shown to present benefits in a variety of animal models of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as cerebral ischemia, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), epilepsy, depression, multiple sclerosis, morphine tolerance, and glioma. Therefore, sinomenine is now considered a potential agent for the prevention and/or treatment of CNS disorders. Mechanistic studies have shown that inhibition of oxidative stress, microglia- or astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis are common mechanisms for the neuroprotective effects of sinomenine. Other mechanisms, including activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (\n              Nrf2\n              ), induction of autophagy in response to inhibition of protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element-binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), may also mediate the anti-glioma and neuroprotective effects of sinomenine. Sinomenine treatment has also been shown to enhance dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2)-mediated nuclear translocation of αB-crystallin (CRYAB) in astrocytes, thereby suppressing neuroinflammation\n              via\n              inhibition of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3).

Our hypothesis is that CT promotes improvements in the studied outcomes with higher results for the combination of CT and CoQ10. Randomized placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-eight patients with MS were randomly divided into 4 groups: CT+placebo, CT+CoQ10, CoQ10 and placebo. CT involved two resistance training sessions and one aerobic training session per week. CoQ10 was supplemented with 200 mg daily. Serum levels of BDNF, NGF and functional tests [timed up and go (TUG), 6-min walk (6MW), chest press, lateral pull down, leg extension, and lying leg curls one repetition maximum] were measured before and after the intervention period. CT+placebo and CT+CoQ10 significantly improved performance in TUG, 6MW, chest press, lateral pull down, leg extension, and lying leg curls, with superior results to both CoQ10 and placebo groups. Changes in TUG for CT+placebo were significantly higher than CT+CoQ10 (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in NGF and BDNF among the four groups (p >0.05).

Previous researches have confirmed that inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome significantly alleviated the severity of EAE mice and the demyelination of spinal cord, but its effect on neuronal damage and oligodendrocyte loss in the brain remains unclear. In this study, female C57BL/6 mice were immunized with MOG35–55 and PTX to establish experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model.

Our results demonstrated that MCC950 ameliorated the neuronal damage, demyelination, and oligodendrocyte loss in the brain of EAE mice. This protective effect of MCC950 may be attributed to its ability to suppress the activation of glial cells and prevents microglia polarization to M1 phenotype.

Identifying functional differences between CNS and blood CD4+ T-cells, therefore, have relevance to CNS immune surveillance as well as to neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, in which CD4+ T-cells play a central role. Here, CD4+ T-cells were purified from CSF and blood from 21 patients with newly diagnosed treatment-naïve multiple sclerosis and 20 individuals with non-inflammatory disorders using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and their transcriptomes were profiled by RNA sequencing. Paired comparisons between CD4+ T-cells from CSF and blood identified 5156 differentially expressed genes in controls and 4263 differentially expressed in multiple sclerosis patients at false discovery rate &lt;5%. Differential expression analysis of CD4+ T-cells collected from the CSF highlighted genes involved in migration, activation, cholesterol biosynthesis and signalling, including those with known relevance to multiple sclerosis pathogenesis and treatment. Expression of markers of CD4+ T-cell subtypes suggested an increased proportion of Th1 and Th17 cells in CSF. Gene ontology terms significant only in multiple sclerosis were predominantly those involved in cellular proliferation. A two-way comparison of CSF versus blood CD4+ T-cells in multiple sclerosis compared with non-inflammatory disorder controls identified four significant genes at false discovery rate &lt;5% (CYP51A1, LRRD1, YES1 and PASK), further implicating cholesterol biosynthesis and migration mechanisms.

However, biologically meaningful latent space is usually missing if no specific structure is designed. Here, we engineered a novel interpretable generative transcriptional program (iGTP) framework that could model the importance of transcriptional program (TP) space and protein-protein interactions (PPI) between different biological states. We demonstrated the performance of iGTP in a diverse biological context using gene ontology, canonical pathway, and different PPI curation. iGTP not only elucidated the ground truth of cellular responses but also surpassed other deep learning models and traditional bioinformatics methods in functional enrichment tasks. By integrating the latent layer with a graph neural network framework, iGTP could effectively infer cellular responses to perturbations. Lastly, we applied iGTP TP embeddings with a latent diffusion model to accurately generate cell embeddings for specific cell types and states.

While current immunotherapy treatments decrease the frequency of demyelinating episodes, they do not promote myelin repair or functional recovery. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neuromodulation therapy which enhances neuroplasticity and the recovery of motor function after stroke, but its effects on myelin repair are not known. To determine if VNS influences myelin repair, we applied VNS following a demyelinating injury and measured longitudinal myelin dynamics and functional recovery. We found that VNS promotes remyelination by increasing the generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Pairing VNS with a skilled reach task leads to the regeneration of myelin sheaths on previously myelinated axon segments, enhancing the restoration of the original pattern of myelination. Moreover, the magnitude of sheath pattern restoration correlates with long-term motor functional improvement. Together, these results suggest that recovery of the myelin sheath pattern is a key factor in the restoration of motor function following myelin loss and identify paired VNS as a potential remyelination therapy to treat demyelinating diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Rongchen"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Elise R."},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Ethan G."},{"family":"Welle","given":"Cristin G."}],"citation-key":"huangPairedVagusNerve2024","DOI":"10.1101/2024.05.10.593609","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,12]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Neuroscience","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Paired vagus nerve stimulation drives precise remyelination and motor recovery after myelin loss","type":"article","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2024.05.10.593609"},{"id":"huangRoleMesenchymalStem2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            Exosomes are nanovesicles with multiple components used in several applications.

However, limited sample sizes have hindered the discovery of variants for uncommon and rare diseases. Here, we introduce KGWAS, a novel geometric deep learning method that leverages a massive functional knowledge graph across variants and genes to improve detection power in small-cohort GWASs significantly. KGWAS assesses the strength of a variant’s association to disease based on the aggregate GWAS evidence across molecular elements interacting with the variant within the knowledge graph. Comprehensive simulations and replication experiments showed that, for small sample sizes (N=1-10K), KGWAS identified up to 100% more statistically significant associations than state-of-the-art GWAS methods and achieved the same statistical power with up to 2.67× fewer samples. We applied KGWAS to 554 uncommon UK Biobank diseases (Ncase &lt;5K) and identified 183 more associations (46.9% improvement) than the original GWAS, where the gain further increases to 79.8% for 141 rare diseases (Ncase &lt;300). The KGWAS-only discoveries are supported by abundant functional evidence, such as rs2155219 (on 11q13) associated with ulcerative colitis potentially via regulating LRRC32 expression in CD4+ regulatory T cells, and rs7312765 (on 12q12) associated with the rare disease myasthenia gravis potentially via regulating PPHLN1 expression in neuron-related cell types. Furthermore, KGWAS consistently improves downstream analyses such as identifying disease-specific network links for interpreting GWAS variants, identifying disease-associated genes, and identifying disease-relevant cell populations. Overall, KGWAS is a flexible and powerful AI model that integrates growing functional genomics data to discover novel variants, genes, cells, and networks, especially valuable for small cohort diseases.Competing Interest StatementSoner Koc, Alexandra Pettet, Laurence Howe, Tom Richardson, Adrian Cortes, Katie Aiello, and Kim Branson are employees of GSK and report ownership of GSK shares and/or restricted GSK shares.Funding StatementK.H. acknowledges support from the Stanford Bio-X Lubert Stryer Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship.

To more directly assess biological processes associated with brain estrogen (estrone, estradiol) levels, we recruited 81 women (42 non-white) and 28 men (13 non-white) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic and volumetric brain analysis. In these mostly post-menopausal women, we found low CSF estrogen levels to only modest correlate with their corresponding plasma levels. Aptamer-based proteomic analysis of CSF markers for inflammation, proteolysis, and DNA/RNA regulation revealed higher CSF estrogen to associate with changes involved in recruitment or activation of neutrophils, monocytes, and complement-related proteins in a race-dependent fashion. Parallel MRI analysis correlated higher CSF estrogen with smaller volumes of the brain somatosensory and posterior-medial networks without influence from cognition or neurodegeneration. These outcomes were only partially associated with plasma estrogens, reinforcing the need for improved CSF estrogen analysis to elucidate brain-specific effects.Competing Interest StatementWTH has served as a consultant to Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Biogen Inc., Fujirebio Diagnostics, and Siemens Healthineers; received research support from Fujirebio USA; and has a patent on CSF-based diagnosis of FTLD-TDP (assigned to Emory University); CSF-based prognosis of SMA (assigned to Emory University); and CSF-based prognosis of very mild AD (assigned to Emory and Rutgers University).

New oligodendrocytes are produced throughout life through a process referred to as oligodendrogenesis. Oligodendrogenesis consists of three canonical stages: the oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC), the premyelinating oligodendrocyte (preOL), and the mature oligodendrocyte (OL). However, the generation of oligodendrocytes is inherently an inefficient process. Following precursor differentiation, a majority of premyelinating oligodendrocytes are lost, likely due to apoptosis. If premyelinating oligodendrocytes progress through this survival checkpoint, they generate new myelinating oligodendrocytes in a process we have termed integration. In this review, we will explore the intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways that influence preOL survival and integration by examining the intrinsic apoptotic pathways, metabolic demands, and the interactions between neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and premyelinating oligodendrocytes. Additionally, we will discuss similarities between the maturation of newly generated neurons and premyelinating oligodendrocytes. Finally, we will consider how increasing survival and integration of preOLs has the potential to increase remyelination in multiple sclerosis. Deepening our understanding of premyelinating oligodendrocyte biology may open the door for new treatments for demyelinating disease and will help paint a clearer picture of how new oligodendrocytes are produced throughout life to facilitate brain function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"Ethan G."},{"family":"Stockton","given":"Michael E."}],"citation-key":"hughesPremyelinatingOligodendrocytesMechanisms2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology","container-title-short":"Front.

To address evidence gaps, we evaluated long COVID susceptibility in pwMSRD versus controls and its associations with multi-domain function and disability.Methods In this multicenter cross-sectional study, participants completed a survey covering 71 post-infection symptoms, distinguishing new-onset from worsening symptoms. We defined long COVID using the 2024 NASEM criteria. Logistic regression assessed long COVID odds. Linear and Poisson regression evaluated associations with function and disability.Results 969 pwMSRD (82.5% female, mean age 51.8 years, 63.5% infected) and 1,003 controls (79.4% female, mean age 45.2 years, 61.2% infected) were included. PwMSRD had higher odds of long COVID (aOR=1.6 [1.2-2.1]), with a stronger association when restricting to worsening symptoms (aOR=2.3 [1.7-3.1]). Having long COVID was associated with worse physical function, cognition, and depression in both groups. PwMSRD with long COVID experienced greater physical function declines and more depression severity exacerbation than controls, and had faster disability progression compared to those without long COVID.Conclusion PwMSRD show increased susceptibility to long COVID, primarily driven by worsening symptoms. Long COVID contributes to more functional decline and disability worsening.

Here, we show aromatic alpha-keto acids (AKAs) generated from the amino acid oxidase, interleukin-4 induced 1 (IL4I1), promote efficient remyelination in mouse models of MS. During remyelination, myeloid cells upregulated the expression of IL4I1. Conditionally knocking out IL4I1 in myeloid cells impaired remyelination efficiency. Mice lacking IL4I1 expression exhibited a reduction in the AKAs, phenylpyruvate, indole-3-pyruvate, and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, in remyelinating lesions. Decreased AKA levels were also observed in people with MS, particularly in the progressive phase when remyelination is impaired. Oral administration of AKAs modulated myeloid cell-associated inflammation, promoted oligodendrocyte maturation, and enhanced remyelination in mice with focal demyelinated lesions. Transcriptomic analysis revealed AKA treatment induced a shift in metabolic pathways in myeloid cells and upregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity in lesions.

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a syndrome characterized by cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 protein and atrophy of motor neurons in the cortex and spinal cord, the transcriptomic signatures of microglia during disease progression are incompletely understood. Here, we performed longitudinal RNAseq analysis of cortical and spinal cord microglia from rNLS8 mice, in which doxycycline-regulatable expression of human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) in the cytoplasm of neurons recapitulates many features of ALS. Transgene suppression in rNLS8 mice leads to functional, anatomical and electrophysiological resolution that is dependent on a microglial reaction that is concurrent with recovery rather than disease onset. We identified basal differences between the gene expression profiles of microglia dependent on localization in spinal cord or cortex.

Blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) have shown promising clinical utility in MS, but they are insufficient to guide clinical management. Plasma tau proteins remain underexplored despite the growing evidence of shared pathology in Alzheimer’s disease and MS. We aimed to: (1) assess the utility of plasma tau biomarkers (phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181], p-tau217, and total tau [t-tau]) in MS diagnosis, subtyping, and prognosis; and (2) compare their performance with NfL and GFAP.Methods From a clinic-based prospective cohort, we included 160 people with MS (pwMS; 117 with relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS], 43 with progressive MS [PMS]) and 20 non-MS controls, all with baseline plasma samples. We measured baseline plasma concentrations of p-tau181, p-tau217, t-tau, NfL, and GFAP using ultrasensitive immunoassays. We collected demographics, clinical information, and longitudinal multi-modal outcomes (Patient Determined Disease Steps [PDDS], normalized age-related MS severity score [ARMSS], walking speed, manual dexterity, cognitive performance, retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL] thickness, total brain volume, and gray matter volume) over a median follow-up of 3.0 years (IQR, 3.5). Adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, we evaluated associations between biomarkers and MS diagnosis, subtypes, and prognosis. We examined the enhanced value of tau markers, in addition to NfL and GFAP, for subtype distinction and outcome prediction. Participants were enrolled between 2017 and 2023. Analyses were conducted in December 2024.Results Participants (n=180) had a median age of 51 years and were predominantly women (68%) and non-Hispanic white (91%). Compared with controls, pwMS had higher levels of p-tau217 (1.0 vs 0.7 pg/mL; p=0.04) and NfL (14.1 vs 9.0 pg/mL; p&lt;0.01). Among pwMS, higher p-tau181 (aOR [95%CI]=2.3 [1.4,4.1]) and p-tau217 (aOR [95%CI]=3.0 [1.8,5.7]) were associated with PMS. These markers improved MS subtype classification accuracy beyond clinical features, NfL, and GFAP. Higher baseline p-tau181 and p-tau217 predicted worse disability, functional outcomes, and imaging outcomes independent of other biomarkers.Conclusions Plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 are promising biomarkers for MS subtype classification and disability prediction, providing complementary information to NfL and GFAP.

METHODS: Eligible patients with RRMS treated with SC interferon-β-1a (IFN-β-1a) 44 μg 3 times weekly and serum 25(OH)D levels <150 nmol/L were included. From February 15, 2011, to May 11, 2015, 229 patients were included and randomized 1:1 to receive SC IFN-β-1a plus placebo (n = 116) or SC IFN-β-1a plus oral high-dose vitamin D(3) 14,007 IU/d (n = 113). The revised primary outcome was the proportion of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) at week 48. RESULTS: At 48 weeks, 36.3% of patients who received high-dose vitamin D(3) had NEDA-3, without a statistically significant difference in NEDA-3 status between groups (placebo 35.3%; odds ratio 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-1.63; p = 0.80).

In MS and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, MSC injection was shown to alter the differentiation of CD4\n              +\n              T cells. This alteration occurred by inducing anergy and reduction in the number of Th17 cells, stimulating the polarization of antigen-specific Treg to reverse the imbalance of the Th17/Treg axis, reducing the inflammatory cascade response and demyelination, and restoring an overall state of immune tolerance.

In an adult MS model of focal de/remyelination, they improve lesion repair by promoting OPC differentiation while preserving the OPC pool. Additionally, they shift microglia from a pro-inflammatory to a pro-regenerative profile and enhance myelin debris clearance. These findings support the repurposing of leucovorin and dyclonine for clinical trials targeting myelin disorders, offering potential therapeutic avenues for PBI and MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Huré","given":"Jean-Baptiste"},{"family":"Foucault","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Ghayad","given":"Litsa Maria"},{"family":"Marie","given":"Corentine"},{"family":"Vachoud","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Baudouin","given":"Lucas"},{"family":"Azmani","given":"Rihab"},{"family":"Ivljanin","given":"Natalija"},{"family":"Arevalo-Nuevo","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Pigache","given":"Morgane"},{"family":"Bouslama-Oueghlani","given":"Lamia"},{"family":"Chemelle","given":"Julie-Anne"},{"family":"Dronne","given":"Marie-Aimée"},{"family":"Terreux","given":"Raphaël"},{"family":"Hassan","given":"Bassem"},{"family":"Gueyffier","given":"François"},{"family":"Raineteau","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Parras","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"hurePharmacogenomicScreeningIdentifies2024","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-024-54003-9","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,13]]},"language":"en","page":"9837","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pharmacogenomic screening identifies and repurposes leucovorin and dyclonine as pro-oligodendrogenic compounds in brain repair","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54003-9","volume":"15"},{"id":"hushpulianEmergingSmallMolecule2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            The transcription factor Nrf2 is the master regulator of cellular stress response, facilitating the expression of cytoprotective genes, including those responsible for drug detoxification, immunomodulation, and iron metabolism. FDA‐approved Nrf2 activators, Tecfidera and Skyclarys for patients with multiple sclerosis and Friedreich's ataxia, respectively, are non‐specific alkylating agents exerting side effects. Nrf2 is under feedback regulation through its target gene, transcriptional repressor Bach1. Specifically, in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases with Bach1 dysregulation, excessive Bach1 accumulation interferes with Nrf2 activation. Bach1 is a heme sensor protein, which, upon heme binding, is targeted for proteasomal degradation, relieving the repression of Nrf2 target genes. Ideally, a combination of Nrf2 stabilization and Bach1 inhibition is necessary to achieve the full therapeutic benefits of Nrf2 activation. Here, we discuss recent advances and future perspectives in developing small molecule inhibitors of Bach1, highlighting the significance of the Bach1/Nrf2 signaling pathway as a promising neurotherapeutic strategy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hushpulian","given":"Dmitry M."},{"family":"Kaidery","given":"Navneet Ammal"},{"family":"Dutta","given":"Debashis"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Sudarshana M."},{"family":"Gazaryan","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Bobby"}],"citation-key":"hushpulianEmergingSmallMolecule2024","container-title":"BioEssays","container-title-short":"BioEssays","DOI":"10.1002/bies.202300176","ISSN":"0265-9247, 1521-1878","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","page":"2300176","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Emerging small molecule inhibitors of Bach1 as therapeutic agents: Rationale, recent advances, and future perspectives","title-short":"Emerging small molecule inhibitors of Bach1 as therapeutic agents","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.202300176","volume":"46"},{"id":"huynhTargetEngagementFirstinclass2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Huynh","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Brussee","given":"Janneke M."},{"family":"Pouzol","given":"Laetitia"},{"family":"Fonseca","given":"Marlene"},{"family":"Meyer Zu Schwabedissen","given":"Henriette E."},{"family":"Dingemanse","given":"Jasper"},{"family":"Sidharta","given":"Patricia N."}],"citation-key":"huynhTargetEngagementFirstinclass2021","container-title":"Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy","container-title-short":"Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112363","ISSN":"07533322","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"112363","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Target engagement of the first-in-class CXCR7 antagonist ACT-1004-1239 following multiple-dose administration in mice and humans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0753332221011471","volume":"144"},{"id":"hvidPersonalisedInpatientMultidisciplinary2021","abstract":"Purpose\n              Evidence of the effects of inpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation (MDR) on physical function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is limited, particularly whether clinically relevant improvements can be achieved.

Both harmful and beneficial myeloid cells are present in EAE/MS, and a goal of MS therapy is to preferentially remove harmful myeloid cells. The receptor for CSF-1 (CSF-1R) is found on myeloid cells and is important for their survival. CSF-1R can bind two ligands, CSF-1 and IL-34, but it is not known whether their functions in EAE/MS differ. We found that blocking CSF-1 depleted only harmful myeloid cells in the CNS and suppressed EAE, whereas blocking IL-34 had no effect. Thus, we propose that blocking CSF-1 could be a therapy for MS.\n          , \n            The receptor for colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1R) is important for the survival and function of myeloid cells that mediate pathology during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). CSF-1 and IL-34, the ligands of CSF-1R, have similar bioactivities but distinct tissue and context-dependent expression patterns, suggesting that they have different roles. This could be the case in EAE, given that CSF-1 expression is up-regulated in the CNS, while IL-34 remains constitutively expressed. We found that targeting CSF-1 with neutralizing antibody halted ongoing EAE, with efficacy superior to CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945, whereas IL-34 neutralization had no effect, suggesting that pathogenic myeloid cells were maintained by CSF-1. Both anti–CSF-1 and BLZ945 treatment greatly reduced the number of monocyte-derived cells and microglia in the CNS. However, anti–CSF-1 selectively depleted inflammatory microglia and monocytes in inflamed CNS areas, whereas BLZ945 depleted virtually all myeloid cells, including quiescent microglia, throughout the CNS. Anti–CSF-1 treatment reduced the size of demyelinated lesions and microglial activation in the gray matter. Lastly, we found that bone marrow–derived immune cells were the major mediators of CSF-1R–dependent pathology, while microglia played a lesser role. Our findings suggest that targeting CSF-1 could be effective in ameliorating MS pathology, while preserving the homeostatic functions of myeloid cells, thereby minimizing risks associated with ablation of CSF-1R–dependent cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hwang","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Seyedsadr","given":"Maryam S."},{"family":"Ishikawa","given":"Larissa Lumi Watanabe"},{"family":"Boehm","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Sahin","given":"Ziver"},{"family":"Casella","given":"Giacomo"},{"family":"Jang","given":"Soohwa"},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Michael V."},{"family":"Garifallou","given":"James P."},{"family":"Hakonarson","given":"Hakon"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Weifeng"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Rostami","given":"Abdolmohamad"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guang-Xian"},{"family":"Ciric","given":"Bogoljub"}],"citation-key":"hwangCSF1MaintainsPathogenic2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

The lack of in-depth literature on the subject, and the limited sharing of the experience gained by companies, limits the creation, dissemination and consolidation of understanding in this area. The purpose of this study is to solve the problem of the absence of knowledge, identification, skills development and introduction of an innovation (such as the AI in the business communication) in the company, with the principles of knowledge management (KM). Design/methodology/approach This study adopts the perspective of KM to provide guidelines for the definition of standards and facilitate the introduction of AI in business communication. Findings To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to relate the perspectives of business communication, AI and KM, activating a virtuous circle between KM and AI. At the centre of the proposed model are people, processes and technologies, based on which KM represents the ideal perspective to define the implementation of AI. This is primarily from the perspective of augmented intelligence, owing to the inability of AI to completely replace humans in the business communication processes, as it lacks, among others, emotional intelligence. Research limitations/implications This study finds in KM a possible strategy to solve the problems faced so far in applying AI in business communication processes, providing a model capable of transforming and adapting itself to the context, thanks to the open approach.

Changes in the gut microbiome are linked to the development of neuroinflammation via mechanisms that are not fully understood. Prebiotics and probiotics in camel milk that has been fermented have a variety of health benefits. In this study, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens-supplemented camel milk (BASY) was used to assess its preventive effect on MS symptoms in a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-immunized C57BL6J mice model. To this end, MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was established and the level of disease index, pathological scores, and anti-inflammatory markers of BASY-treated mice using macroscopic and microscopic examinations, qPCR and immunoblot were investigated. The results demonstrate that BASY significantly reduced the EAE disease index, increased total microbial load (2.5 fold), and improved the levels of the short-chain fatty acids propionic, butyric and caproic acids in the diseased mice group. Additionally, myeloperoxidase (MPO) proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β) were regulated by BASY treatment. Significant suppression of MPO and VCAM levels were noticed in the BASY-treated group (from 168 to 111 µM and from 34 to 27 pg/mL, respectively), in comparison to the EAE group. BASY treatment significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory progression related transcripts, and inflammatory progression protein markers. In conclusion, BASY significantly reduced the symptoms of EAE mice and may be used to develop a probiotic-based diet to promote host gut health. The cumulative findings of this study confirm the significant neuroprotection of BASY in the MOG-induced mice model. They could also suggest a novel approach to the treatment of MS-associated disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Hairul Islam Mohamed"},{"family":"Sheikh","given":"Abdullah"},{"family":"Khalil","given":"Hany Ezzat"},{"family":"Khalifa","given":"Ashraf"}],"citation-key":"ibrahimBacillusAmyloliquifaciensSupplementedCamel2023","container-title":"Nutrients","container-title-short":"Nutrients","DOI":"10.3390/nu15030550","ISSN":"2072-6643","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,20]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"550","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bacillus amyloliquifaciens-Supplemented Camel Milk Suppresses Neuroinflammation of Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis in a Mouse Model by Regulating Inflammatory Markers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/3/550","volume":"15"},{"id":"ibrahimfouadRemyelinatingActivitiesCarvedilol2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ibrahim Fouad","given":"Ghadha"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Kawkab A."}],"citation-key":"ibrahimfouadRemyelinatingActivitiesCarvedilol2023","container-title":"International Immunopharmacology","container-title-short":"International Immunopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2023.110125","ISSN":"15675769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"en","page":"110125","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Remyelinating activities of Carvedilol or alpha lipoic acid in the Cuprizone-Induced rat model of demyelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567576923004460","volume":"118"},{"id":"ibrahimMicroRNA71885pMiR7235Regulates2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Hairul-Islam Mohamed"},{"family":"AlZahrani","given":"Abdullah"},{"family":"Hanieh","given":"Hamza"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Emad A."},{"family":"Thirugnanasambantham","given":"Krishnaraj"}],"citation-key":"ibrahimMicroRNA71885pMiR7235Regulates2021","container-title":"Molecular Immunology","container-title-short":"Molecular Immunology","DOI":"10.1016/j.molimm.2021.07.002","ISSN":"01615890","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"language":"en","page":"157-167","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"MicroRNA-7188-5p and miR-7235 regulates Multiple sclerosis in an experimental mouse model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016158902100208X","volume":"139"},{"id":"ibrahimPreferentialEffectClemastine2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Sherehan M."},{"family":"Kamel","given":"Ahmed S."},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Kawkab A."},{"family":"Mohammed","given":"Reham A."},{"family":"Essam","given":"Reham M."}],"citation-key":"ibrahimPreferentialEffectClemastine2024","container-title":"International Immunopharmacology","container-title-short":"International Immunopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2023.111481","ISSN":"15675769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2]]},"language":"en","page":"111481","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The preferential effect of Clemastine on F3/Contactin-1/Notch-1 compared to Jagged-1/Notch-1 justifies its remyelinating effect in an experimental model of multiple sclerosis in rats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567576923018088","volume":"128"},{"id":"imitolaStat1InducibleTranscriptional2023","abstract":"A central issue in regenerative medicine is understanding the mechanisms that regulate the self-renewal of endogenous stem cells in response to injury and disease. Interferons increase hematopoietic stem cells during infection by activating STAT1, but the mechanisms by which STAT1 regulates intrinsic programs in neural stem cells (NSCs) during neuroinflammation is less known. Here we explored the role of STAT1 on NSC self-renewal. We show that overexpressing\n              Stat1\n              in NSCs derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) decreases NSC self-renewal capacity while\n              Stat1\n              deletion increases NSC self-renewal, neurogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis in isolated NSCs. Importantly, we find upregulation of STAT1 in NSCs in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS) and an increase in pathological T cells expressing IFN-γ rather than interleukin 17 (IL-17) in the cerebrospinal fluid of affected mice. We find IFN-γ is superior to IL-17 in reducing proliferation and precipitating an abnormal NSC phenotype featuring increased STAT1 phosphorylation and\n              Stat1\n              and\n              p16\n              ink4a\n              gene expression.

Lastly, we identified a\n              Stat1\n              -dependent gene expression profile associated with an increase in the\n              Sox9\n              transcription factor, a regulator of self-renewal.\n              Stat1\n              binds and transcriptionally represses\n              Sox9\n              in a transcriptional luciferase assay.

We survey 319 knowledge workers to investigate 1) when and how they perceive the enaction of critical thinking when using GenAI, and 2) when and why GenAI affects their effort to do so. Participants shared 936 first-hand examples of using GenAI in work tasks. Quantitatively, when considering both task- and user-specific factors, a user’s task-specific self-confidence and confidence in GenAI are predictive of whether critical thinking is enacted and the effort of doing so in GenAI-assisted tasks.

Myelination requires dramatic cytoskeletal dynamics in oligodendrocytes, but how actin is regulated during myelination is poorly understood. We recently identified serum response factor (SRF)—a transcription factor known to regulate expression of actin and actin regulators in other cell types—as a critical driver of myelination in the aged brain. Yet, a major gap remains in understanding the mechanistic role of SRF in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Here, we show that SRF is required cell autonomously in oligodendrocytes for myelination during development. Combining ChIP-seq with RNA-seq identifies SRF-target genes in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and oligodendrocytes that include actin and other key cytoskeletal genes. Accordingly, SRF knockout oligodendrocytes exhibit dramatically reduced actin filament levels early in differentiation, consistent with its role in actin-dependent myelin sheath initiation. Surprisingly, oligodendrocyte-restricted loss of SRF results in upregulation of gene signatures associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Together, our findings identify SRF as a transcriptional regulator that controls the expression of cytoskeletal genes required in oligodendrocytes for myelination. This study identifies an essential pathway regulating oligodendrocyte biology with high relevance to brain development, aging, and disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Iram","given":"Tal"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Miguel A."},{"family":"Amand","given":"Jérémy"},{"family":"Kaur","given":"Achint"},{"family":"Atkins","given":"Micaiah"},{"family":"Iyer","given":"Manasi"},{"family":"Lam","given":"Mable"},{"family":"Ambiel","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Jorgens","given":"Danielle M."},{"family":"Keller","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Wyss-Coray","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Kern","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Zuchero","given":"J.

Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been identified as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for multiple sclerosis (MS), existing evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of this strategy remains inconclusive. Thus, the primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) was to comprehensively assess the effectiveness and safety of MSC therapy in individuals diagnosed with MS. A comprehensive search was conducted using appropriate keywords in the PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases to determine the eligible studies. The change in the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score from baseline to follow-up was used to assess MSC efficacy. The effectiveness of the therapy was assessed using a random-effects model, which calculated the combined prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MS patients who experienced improvement, stability, or worsening of their condition. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020209671). The findings indicate that 40.4% (95% CI: 30.6–50.2) of MS patients exhibited improvements following MSC therapy, 32.8% (95% CI: 25.5–40.1) remained stable, and 18.1% (95% CI: 12.0–24.2) experienced a worsening of their condition. Although no major complications were observed, headaches 57.6 [37.9–77.3] and fever 53.1 [20.7–85.4] were commonly reported as minor adverse events. All of the results reported in this meta-analysis are consistent and credible according to the sensitivity analyses. Regardless of different individual studies, our meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview showing the potential of MSC therapy as a possible effective treatment strategy for patients with MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Islam","given":"Md Asiful"},{"family":"Alam","given":"Sayeda Sadia"},{"family":"Kundu","given":"Shoumik"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Saleh"},{"family":"Sultana","given":"Shabiha"},{"family":"Patar","given":"Azim"},{"family":"Hossan","given":"Tareq"}],"citation-key":"islamMesenchymalStemCell2023","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","container-title-short":"JCM","DOI":"10.3390/jcm12196311","ISSN":"2077-0383","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,30]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"6311","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy in Multiple Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","title-short":"Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy in Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/19/6311","volume":"12"},{"id":"islamPolyphenolsTargetingMAP2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Islam","given":"Fahadul"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Sumon"},{"family":"Zehravi","given":"Mehrukh"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Shyamjit"},{"family":"Sutradhar","given":"Hriday"},{"family":"Yaidikar","given":"Lavanya"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"B.

The conduit was transplanted to bridge the 5-mm gaps of Lewis rat sciatic nerve, and nerve regeneration was evaluated at 8 weeks (Bio 3D group). Transplantation of autologous nerve segments (autograft) and silicone tubes represented the positive and negative control groups, respectively. In a second experiment, immunological reactions were evaluated in Bio 3D, autograft, and allograft groups by histochemical staining of transplanted segments in Brown Norway rats.\n              Results:\n              The mean angle of attack value in the kinematic analysis was significantly better in the Bio 3D group (‒20.1 ± 0.5°) than in the silicone group (‒33.7 ± 1.5°) 8 weeks after surgery.

We previously reported elevated neuroinflammation and severe periventricular white matter damage in the\n              progressive hydrocephalus\n              (\n              prh\n              ) mutant which contains a point mutation in the\n              Ccdc39\n              gene, causing loss of cilia-mediated unidirectional CSF flow. In this study, we identified cortical neuropil maturation defects such as impaired excitatory synapse maturation and loss of homeostatic microglia, and swimming locomotor defects in early postnatal\n              prh\n              mutant mice. Strikingly, systemic application of the anti-inflammatory small molecule bindarit significantly supports healthy postnatal cerebral cortical development in the\n              prh\n              mutant. While bindarit only mildly reduced the ventricular volume, it significantly improved the edematous appearance and myelination of the corpus callosum. Moreover, the treatment attenuated thinning in cortical Layers II–IV, excitatory synapse formation, and interneuron morphogenesis, by supporting the ramified-shaped homeostatic microglia from excessive cell death. Also, the therapeutic effect led to the alleviation of a spastic locomotor phenotype of the mutant. We found that microglia, but not peripheral monocytes, contribute to amoeboid-shaped activated myeloid cells in\n              prh\n              mutants' corpus callosum and the proinflammatory cytokines expression. Bindarit blocks nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation and its downstream proinflammatory cytokines, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, in the\n              prh\n              mutant.

There are no specific treatments for the neurological alterations in HE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reduce neuroinflammation in some pathological conditions. The aims were to assess if treatment of hyperammonemic rats with EVs from MSCs restores cognitive function and analyze the underlying mechanisms. EVs injected in vivo reach the hippocampus and restore performance of hyperammonemic rats in object location, object recognition, short-term memory in the Y-maze and reference memory in the radial maze. Hyperammonemic rats show reduced TGFβ levels and membrane expression of TGFβ receptors in hippocampus. This leads to microglia activation and reduced Smad7–IkB pathway, which induces NF-κB nuclear translocation in neurons, increasing IL-1β which alters AMPA and NMDA receptors membrane expression, leading to cognitive impairment. These effects are reversed by TGFβ in the EVs from MSCs, which activates TGFβ receptors, reducing microglia activation and NF-κB nuclear translocation in neurons by normalizing the Smad7–IkB pathway. This normalizes IL-1β, AMPA and NMDA receptors membrane expression and, therefore, cognitive function.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterised by inflammation, demyelination, axonal or neuronal loss, and astrocytic gliosis in the central nervous system (CNS), which can result in varying levels of disability. Some studies have provided evidence showing an association of MS with low levels of vitamin D and benefit derived from its supplementation. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefit and safety of vitamin D supplementation for reducing disease activity in people with MS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the CNS Specialized Register up to 2 October 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist with search terms relevant to this review. We included references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and from handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books from conferences. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared vitamin D versus placebo, routine care, or low doses of vitamin D in patients with MS. Vitamin D was administered as monotherapy or in combination with calcium. Concomitant interventions were allowed if they were used equally in all trial intervention groups. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of studies, while another review author sorted any disagreements. We expressed treatment effects as mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes (Expanded Disability Status Scale and number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions), as standardised MDs for health-related quality of life, as rate differences for annualised relapse rates, and as risk differences (RDs) for serious adverse events and minor adverse events, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 RCTs enrolling 933 participants with MS; 464 were randomised to the vitamin D group, and 469 to the comparator group. Eleven trials tested vitamin D₃, and one trial tested vitamin D₂. Vitamin D₃ had no effect on the annualised relapse rate at 52 weeks' follow-up (rate difference -0.05, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.07; I² = 38%; five trials; 417 participants; very low-quality evidence according to the GRADE instrument); on the Expanded Disability Status Scale at 52 weeks' follow-up (MD -0.25, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.10; I² = 35%; five trials; 221 participants; very low-quality evidence according to GRADE); and on MRI gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions at 52 weeks' follow-up (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.48; I² = 12%; two trials; 256 participants; very low-quality evidence according to GRADE). Vitamin D₃ did not increase the risk of serious adverse effects within a range of 26 to 52 weeks' follow-up (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04; I² = 35%; eight trials; 621 participants; low-quality evidence according to GRADE) or minor adverse effects within a range of 26 to 96 weeks' follow-up (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06; I² = 20%; eight trials; 701 participants; low-quality evidence according to GRADE). Three studies reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using different HRQOL scales. One study reported that vitamin D improved ratings on the psychological and social components of the HRQOL scale but had no effects on the physical components. The other two studies found no effect of vitamin D on HRQOL. Two studies reported fatigue using different scales. One study (158 participants) reported that vitamin D₃ reduced fatigue compared with placebo at 26 weeks' follow-up. The other study (71 participants) found no effect on fatigue at 96 weeks' follow-up. Seven studies reported on cytokine levels, four on T-lymphocyte proliferation, and one on matrix metalloproteinase levels, with no consistent pattern of change in these immunological outcomes. The randomised trials included in this review provided no data on time to first treated relapse, number of participants requiring hospitalisation owing to progression of the disease, proportion of participants who remained relapse-free, cognitive function, or psychological symptoms. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: To date, very low-quality evidence suggests no benefit of vitamin D for patient-important outcomes among people with MS. Vitamin D appears to have no effect on recurrence of relapse, worsening of disability measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and MRI lesions. Effects on health-related quality of life and fatigue are unclear. Vitamin D₃ at the doses and treatment durations used in the included trials appears to be safe, although available data are limited. Seven ongoing studies will likely provide further evidence that can be included in a future update of this review.","author":[{"literal":"Jagannath V A"},{"literal":"Filippini G"},{"literal":"Di Pietrantonj C"},{"literal":"Asokan G V"},{"literal":"Robak E W"},{"literal":"Whamond L"},{"literal":"Robinson S A"}],"citation-key":"jagannathvaVitaminManagementMultiple2018","container-title":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3","ISSN":"1361-6137","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"Cd008422","title":"Vitamin D for the management of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008422.pub3","volume":"9"},{"id":"jakimovskiUblituximabxiiyTreatmentOption2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Jakimovski","given":"Dejan"},{"family":"Weinstock-Guttman","given":"Bianca"},{"family":"Zivadinov","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"jakimovskiUblituximabxiiyTreatmentOption2023","container-title":"Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics","container-title-short":"Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics","DOI":"10.1080/14737175.2023.2268842","ISSN":"1473-7175, 1744-8360","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1053-1061","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ublituximab-xiiy as a treatment option for relapsing multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737175.2023.2268842","volume":"23"},{"id":"jalalikondoriIntraperitonealInjectionMesenchymal2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Jalali Kondori","given":"Bahman"},{"family":"Abdolmaleki","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Raei","given":"Mahdi"},{"family":"Ghorbani Alvanegh","given":"Akbar"},{"family":"Esmaeili Gouvarchin Ghaleh","given":"Hadi"}],"citation-key":"jalalikondoriIntraperitonealInjectionMesenchymal2024","container-title":"Transplant Immunology","container-title-short":"Transplant Immunology","DOI":"10.1016/j.trim.2024.102067","ISSN":"09663274","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8]]},"language":"en","page":"102067","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Intraperitoneal injection of mesenchymal stem cells-conditioned media (MSCS-CM) treated monocyte can potentially alleviate motor defects in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis female mice; An original experimental study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0966327424000832","volume":"85"},{"id":"jallouliEffectMelatoninIntake2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Jallouli","given":"Sonda"},{"family":"Ghroubi","given":"Sameh"},{"family":"Dhia","given":"Imen Ben"},{"family":"Yahia","given":"Abdelmoneem"},{"family":"Elleuch","given":"Mohamed Habib"},{"family":"Sakka","given":"Salma"},{"family":"Mhiri","given":"Chokri"},{"family":"Hammouda","given":"Omar"}],"citation-key":"jallouliEffectMelatoninIntake2024","container-title":"International Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"International Journal of Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1080/00207454.2022.2090353","ISSN":"0020-7454, 1543-5245","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2]]},"language":"en","page":"137-147","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect of melatonin intake on postural balance, functional mobility and fall risk in persons with multiple sclerosis: a pilot study","title-short":"Effect of melatonin intake on postural balance, functional mobility and fall risk in persons with multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00207454.2022.2090353","volume":"134"},{"id":"jallouliEffectsMelatoninSupplementation2025","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Jallouli","given":"Sonda"},{"family":"Ghroubi","given":"Sameh"},{"family":"Bouattour","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Sakka","given":"Salma"},{"family":"Damak","given":"Mariem"},{"family":"Mhiri","given":"Chokri"},{"family":"Yahia","given":"Abdelmoneem"},{"family":"Elleuch","given":"Mohamed Habib"},{"family":"De Marco","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Driss","given":"Tarak"},{"family":"Hammouda","given":"Omar"}],"citation-key":"jallouliEffectsMelatoninSupplementation2025","container-title":"Journal of Dietary Supplements","container-title-short":"Journal of Dietary Supplements","DOI":"10.1080/19390211.2024.2449030","ISSN":"1939-0211, 1939-022X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,23]]},"language":"en","page":"1-26","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of Melatonin Supplementation on Muscle Strength, Manual Dexterity, and Postural Balance in Patients Living with Multiple sclerosis - A Randomized Controlled Trial","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19390211.2024.2449030"},{"id":"janakiramanEngineeredFcFusion2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            Current effective therapies for autoimmune diseases rely on systemic immunomodulation that broadly affects all T and/or B cell responses.

Albeit multiple strategies to induce T cell tolerance in an autoantigen-specific manner have been proposed, therapeutic removal of autoantibodies remains a significant challenge. Here, we devised an approach to target both autoantigen-specific T cells and autoantibodies by producing a central nervous system (CNS) autoantigen myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-Fc fusion protein. We demonstrate that MOG-Fc fusion protein has significantly higher bioavailability than monomeric MOG and is efficient in clearing anti-MOG autoantibodies from circulation. We also show that MOG-Fc promotes T cell tolerance and protects mice from MOG-induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind that are not fully understood. There is some evidence showing that MS and MT are interconnected via different pathways: Relapses of MS has a direct correlation with a low level of MT secretion and a growing body of evidence suggest that MT be therapeutic in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE, a recognise animal model of MS) severity. Previous studies have demonstrated that the kynurenine pathway (KP), the main pathway of TRP catabolism, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of MS in humans and in EAE. The present study aimed to investigate whether MT can improve clinical signs in the EAE model by modulating the KP. C57BL/6 mice were induced with EAE and received different doses of MT. Then the onset and severity of EAE clinical symptoms were recorded. Two biological factors, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and NAD\n              +\n              which closely interact in the KP were also assessed. The results indicated that MT treatment at all tested doses significantly decrease the EAE clinical scores and the number of demyelinating plaques. Furthermore, MT treatment reduced the mRNA expression of the KP regulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1(IDO-1) and other KP enzymes. We also found that MT treatment reduces the mRNA expression of the AhR and inhibits the enzyme Nicotinamide N-Methyltransferase (Nnmt) overexpression leading to an increase in NAD\n              +\n               levels.

All patients must have been on IFNβ-1b for at least six months, have at least one enhancing lesion on a screening MRI, at least one relapse on IFNβ-1b in the six months prior to study entry and be neutralizing antibody negative. Monthly MRI scans using triple dose contrast and a 30-minute delay between contrast administration and scanning were carried out three times over two months to obtain baseline numbers of enhancing lesions each month. At the end of the baseline phase, MITX was administered at 12 mg/m\n              2\n              (month 3), and 5 mg/m\n              2\n              at months 4 and 5.

The primary outcome measure was the frequency of new enhancing lesions. Secondary outcome measures included relapse rate, and T1 hypointense and T2 lesion burden. Results: Following the addition of MITX to IFNβ-1b mean enhancing lesion frequency decreased 90% at month 7 (P=0.008) and enhancing lesion volume decreased by 96% (P=0.01). Relapse rates decreased 64% (P=0.004). T2 lesion burden and T1 hypointense lesion burden increased slightly during the baseline phase and decreased following MITX but the difference did not reach statistical significance. There were no serious adverse events on combination therapy and no drop-outs due to toxicity. Total white blood cell count was reduced at 14 days post-MITX infusion but returned to normal levels by day 21. There were no neutropenic fevers and there was no clinically significant elevation of liver function tests.

However, unlike other tissues, brain tissue has a specific structure, consisting of synapses. These synapses not only transmit but also process and refine information. Therefore, synaptic regeneration plays a key role in therapy of neurodegenerative disorders. Neurexins (NRXNs) and neuroligins (NLGNs) are synaptic cell adhesion molecules that connect pre- and postsynaptic neurons at synapses, mediate trans-synaptic signaling, and shape neural network properties by specifying synaptic functions. In this study, we investigated the synaptic regeneration effect of human neural stem cells (NSCs) overexpressing NRXNs (F3.NRXN) and NLGNs (F3.NLGN) in a spinal cord injury model. Overexpression of NRXNs and NLGNs in the neural stem cells upregulated the expression of synaptophysin, PSD95, VAMP2, and synapsin, which are synaptic markers. The BMS scores indicated that the transplantation of F3.NRXN and F3.NLGN enhanced the recovery of locomotor function in adult rodents following spinal cord injury. Transplanted F3.NRXN and F3.NLGN differentiated into neurons and formed a synapse with the host cells in the spinal cord injury mouse model. In addition, F3.NRXN and F3.NLGN cells restored growth factors (GFs) and neurotrophic factors (NFs) and induced the proliferation of host cells. This study suggested that NSCs overexpressing NRXNs and NLGNs could be candidates for cell therapy in spinal cord injuries by facilitating synaptic regeneration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Jeong","given":"Jiwon"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Yunseo"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Narae"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Haneul"},{"family":"Yoon","given":"Eun-Jung"},{"family":"Park","given":"Dongsun"}],"citation-key":"jeongEffectsHumanNeural2024","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms25168744","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,10]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"8744","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of Human Neural Stem Cells Overexpressing Neuroligin and Neurexin in a Spinal Cord Injury Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/16/8744","volume":"25"},{"id":"jiaEdaravonePromotesMotoneuron2025","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Jia","given":"Cai-Ju"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Man-Ni"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Dou-Dou"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shao-Feng"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Chun-Ming"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhe-Qi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Meng-Xia"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yan-Feng"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Qiu-Ju"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xie"}],"citation-key":"jiaEdaravonePromotesMotoneuron2025","container-title":"International Immunopharmacology","container-title-short":"International Immunopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2024.113686","ISSN":"15675769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1]]},"language":"en","page":"113686","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Edaravone promotes motoneuron survival and functional recovery after brachial plexus root avulsion and reimplantation in rats: Involvement of SIRT1/TFEB pathway","title-short":"Edaravone promotes motoneuron survival and functional recovery after brachial plexus root avulsion and reimplantation in rats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567576924022082","volume":"145"},{"id":"jiangEffectsNogoAIts2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Junjie"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Yuanchen"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhiwu"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaohua"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Shengjun"}],"citation-key":"jiangEffectsNogoAIts2021","container-title":"Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research","container-title-short":"Braz J Med Biol Res","DOI":"10.1590/1414-431x2020e10842","ISSN":"1414-431X, 0100-879X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"e10842","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of Nogo-A and its receptor on the repair of sciatic nerve injury in rats","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0100-879X2021000900606&tlng=en","volume":"54"},{"id":"jiangjEfficacyProbioticsMultiple2021","abstract":"Preliminary evidence shows the potential role of probiotics in ameliorating multiple sclerosis (MS); however, the effects of probiotics on MS remain unclear.

PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane central of randomized clinical trials, EMBASE, Clinical Trials, and a search engine Google Scholar were systematically searched and manually screened updated to November 2020, resulting in eligible 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 22 preclinical studies. Meta-analysis of RCTs enrolling 173 patients with MS receiving probiotics revealed significant beneficial effects of probiotic supplementation on mental health (expanded disability status scale scores: standardized mean difference [SMD] = -1.22; I(2) = 92%; 95% CI, -2.40 to -0.03, P = 0.04; Beck depression inventory total scores: SMD = -1.58; I(2) = 94%; 95% CI, -3.03 to -0.12; P = 0.03; general health questionnaire scores: SMD = -0.71; I(2) = 0%; 95% CI, -1.02 to -0.40; P < 0.00001; depression anxiety and stress scale scores: SMD = -0.72; I(2) = 0%; 95% CI, -1.12 to -0.33; P = 0.0003), with very low certainty of evidence. In addition, probiotic intake markedly improved insulin resistance and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. Preclinical studies have shown that probiotic consumption reduces the incidence and severity of MS, delays MS progression (15 studies), and improves motor impairment (3 studies) with favorable alterations of immune and inflammatory markers (20 studies) and intestinal microbiome compositions (4 studies) in MS. These results indicated that probiotics may have beneficial effects on the prevention and treatment of multiple sclerosis.","author":[{"literal":"Jiang J"},{"literal":"Chu C"},{"literal":"Wu C"},{"literal":"Wang C"},{"literal":"Zhang C"},{"literal":"Li T"},{"literal":"Zhai Q"},{"literal":"Yu L"},{"literal":"Tian F"},{"literal":"Chen W"}],"citation-key":"jiangjEfficacyProbioticsMultiple2021","container-title":"Food Funct","DOI":"10.1039/d0fo03203d","ISSN":"2042-6496","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"2354-2377","title":"Efficacy of probiotics in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review of preclinical trials and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1039/d0fo03203d","volume":"12"},{"id":"jiangNeuroprotectiveEffectVesatolimod2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xian"},{"family":"Song","given":"Yifan"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaosheng"},{"family":"Mu","given":"Shuhua"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jian"}],"citation-key":"jiangNeuroprotectiveEffectVesatolimod2023","container-title":"International Immunopharmacology","container-title-short":"International Immunopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2023.109717","ISSN":"15675769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"language":"en","page":"109717","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neuroprotective effect of Vesatolimod in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567576923000401","volume":"116"},{"id":"jiBuShenYi2022","abstract":"Remyelination is a refractory feature of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Studies have shown that promoting oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation, which cannot be achieved by currently available therapeutic agents, is the key to enhancing remyelination. Bu Shen Yi Sui capsule (BSYSC) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine over many years of clinical practice. We have found that BSYSC can effectively treat MS. In this study, the effects of BSYSC in promoting OPCs differentiation and remyelination were assessed using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in vivo and cultured OPCs in vitro. The results showed that BSYSC reduced clinical function scores and increased neuroprotection. The expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFR-α) was decreased and the level of 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) was increased in the brains and spinal cords of mice as well as in OPCs after treatment with BSYSC. We further found that BSYSC elevated the expression of miR-219 or miR-338 in the serum exosomes of mice with EAE, thereby suppressing the expression of Sox6, Lingo1, and Hes5, which negatively regulate OPCs differentiation. Therefore, serum exosomes of BSYSC-treated mice (exos-BSYSC) were extracted and administered to OPCs in which miR-219 or miR-338 expression was knocked down by adenovirus, and the results showed that Sox6, Lingo1, and Hes5 expression was downregulated, MBP expression was upregulated, OPCs differentiation was increased, and the ability of OPCs to wrap around neuronal axons was improved. In conclusion, BSYSC may exert clinically relevant effects by regulating microRNA (miR) levels in exosomes and thus promoting the differentiation and maturation of OPCs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ji","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Ya-Qin"},{"family":"Zha","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jun-Ling"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Liang-Yun"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Fang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Yong-Ping"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lei"}],"citation-key":"jiBuShenYi2022","container-title":"Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine","container-title-short":"Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine","DOI":"10.1155/2022/3341481","editor":[{"family":"Li","given":"Xing"}],"ISSN":"1741-4288, 1741-427X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1-19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bu Shen Yi Sui Capsules Promote Remyelination by Regulating MicroRNA-219 and MicroRNA-338 in Exosomes to Promote Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell Differentiation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2022/3341481/","volume":"2022"},{"id":"jiMicrogliaderivedExosomesModulate2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            Demyelination and failure of remyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) characterize a number of neurological disorders. Spontaneous remyelination in demyelinating diseases is limited, as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which are often present in demyelinated lesions in abundance, mostly fail to differentiate into oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells in the CNS. In addition to OPCs, the lesions are assembled numbers of activated resident microglia/infiltrated macrophages; however, the mechanisms and potential role of interactions between the microglia/macrophages and OPCs are poorly understood. Here, we generated a transcriptional profile of exosomes from activated microglia, and found that miR-615-5p was elevated. miR-615-5p bound to 3′UTR of myelin regulator factor (MYRF), a crucial myelination transcription factor expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Mechanistically, exosomes from activated microglia transferred miR-615-5p to OPCs, which directly bound to MYRF and inhibited OPC maturation. Furthermore, an effect of AAV expressing miR-615-5p sponge in microglia was tested in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination model, the classical mouse models of multiple sclerosis. miR-615-5p sponge effectively alleviated disease progression and promoted remyelination.

We reveal that the impact of Eomes on effector CD4+ T cell longevity is associated with sustained expression of multiple genes involved in mitochondrial organization and functions. Accordingly, epigenetic studies demonstrate that Eomes supports mitochondrial function by direct binding to either metabolism-associated genes or mitochondrial transcriptional modulators. Besides, the significance of these findings was confirmed in CD4+ T cells from healthy donors and multiple sclerosis patients.

Rare coding variants, which can profoundly impact gene function, represent an underexplored dimension of ADHD risk. In this study, we analyzed large-scale DNA sequencing datasets from ancestrally diverse cohorts and observed significant enrichment of rare protein-truncating and deleterious missense variants in highly evolutionarily constrained genes. This analysis identified 15 high-confidence ADHD risk genes, including the previously implicated KDM5B. Integrating these findings with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data revealed nine enriched pathways, with strong involvement in synapse organization, neuronal development, and chromatin regulation. Protein–protein interaction analyses identified chromatin regulators as central network hubs, and single-cell transcriptomic profiling confirmed their expression in neurons and glial cells, with distinct patterns in oligodendrocyte subtypes. These findings advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of ADHD, uncover core molecular mechanisms, and provide promising directions for future therapeutic development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by a grant from Beatrice and Samuel A.

With age, differentiation efficacy decreases and myelin repair fails; therefore, recent therapeutic efforts have focused on enhancing differentiation. Many cues are thought to regulate OPC differentiation, including neuronal activity, which OPCs can sense and respond to via their voltage-gated ion channels and glutamate receptors. However, OPCs’ density of voltage-gated ion channels and glutamate receptors differs with age and brain region, and correlates with their proliferation and differentiation potential, suggesting that OPCs exist in different functional cell states, and that age-associated states might underlie remyelination failure. Here, we use whole-cell patch-clamp to investigate whether clemastine and metformin, two pro-remyelination compounds, alter OPC membrane properties and promote a specific OPC state. We find that clemastine and metformin extend the window of NMDAR surface expression, promoting an NMDAR-rich OPC state. Our findings highlight a possible mechanism for the pro-remyelinating action of clemastine and metformin, and suggest that OPC states can be modulated as a strategy to promote myelin repair.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kamen","given":"Yasmine"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Kimberley Anne"},{"family":"Sitnikov","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Spitzer","given":"Sonia Olivia"},{"family":"De Faria","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Yucel","given":"Mert"},{"family":"Káradóttir","given":"Ragnhildur Thóra"}],"citation-key":"kamenClemastineMetforminExtend2024","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-024-53615-x","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,19]]},"language":"en","page":"4091","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Clemastine and metformin extend the window of NMDA receptor surface expression in ageing oligodendrocyte precursor cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53615-x","volume":"14"},{"id":"kamyanOzanimodmediatedRemissionExperimental2024","abstract":"Background\n              Ozanimod (RPC1063) is an immunomodulator that has been recently approved by the FDA (2020) for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It is a selective agonist of the sphingosine-1-phophate receptors 1 and 5, expressed on naïve and central memory T and B cells, as well as natural killer (NK) cells, and is involved in lymphocyte trafficking. Oral administration of ozanimod was reported to result in rapid and reversible reduction in circulating lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, however, only minimal effect on NK cells was observed.

Their dysfunction has been associated with a group of disorders known as demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. Oligodendrocytes are derived from oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which differentiate into premyelinating oligodendrocytes and eventually mature oligodendrocytes. The development and function of oligodendrocytes are tightly regulated by a variety of molecules, including laminin, a major protein of the extracellular matrix. Accumulating evidence suggests that laminin actively regulates every aspect of oligodendrocyte biology, including survival, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and myelination. How can laminin exert such diverse functions in oligodendrocytes? It is speculated that the distinct laminin isoforms, laminin receptors, and/or key signaling molecules expressed in oligodendrocytes at different developmental stages are the reasons. Understanding molecular targets and signaling pathways unique to each aspect of oligodendrocyte biology will enable more accurate manipulation of oligodendrocyte development and function, which may have implications in the therapies of demyelinating diseases. Here in this review, we first introduce oligodendrocyte biology, followed by the expression of laminin and laminin receptors in oligodendrocytes and other CNS cells. Next, the functions of laminin in oligodendrocyte biology, including survival, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and myelination, are discussed in detail. Last, key questions and challenges in the field are discussed. By providing a comprehensive review on laminin's roles in OL lineage cells, we hope to stimulate novel hypotheses and encourage new research in the field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kang","given":"Minkyung"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Yao"}],"citation-key":"kangLamininRegulatesOligodendrocyte2022","container-title":"Glia","container-title-short":"Glia","DOI":"10.1002/glia.24117","ISSN":"0894-1491, 1098-1136","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","page":"414-429","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Laminin regulates oligodendrocyte development and myelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/glia.24117","volume":"70"},{"id":"kanhaiKineticsMyelinBreakdown2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              The majority of disease modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) reduce inflammation, but do no’t target remyelination.

The effect of MS on the NO‐Sulf (49.4% lower fraction with non‐negligible turnover) was more pronounced compared to the effect on β‐GalC turnover (18.3% lower fraction with non‐negligible turnover). Kinetics of myelin breakdown products in the CSF are different in patients with MS compared with healthy subjects. This may be caused by slower myelin production in these patients, by a higher level of degradation of a more stable component of myelin, or, most likely, by a combination of these two processes. Labeling myelin breakdown products is a useful method that can be used to quantify myelin turnover in patients with progressive MS and can therefore be used in proof‐of‐concept studies with remyelination therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kanhai","given":"Kawita M.

Subsequently, innovations, recent developments, and promising treatments based on the stage of disorder progression are further explored. Then, the challenges to be addressed before implementation of these therapies in clinical practice are considered. Finally, potential solutions to overcome the current limitations of this growing research area are suggested.

DNA repair and reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathways have long been investigated as targets for cancer treatment, but their role in immunological research has been limited. In this MiniReview, we discuss the DNA repair enzymes MTH1 and OGG1 as targets to treat both T cell‐driven diseases and acute inflammation. The MiniReview is based on a PhD thesis where both enzymes were investigated with cell and animal models. For MTH1, we found that its inhibition selectively kills activated T cells without being toxic to resting cells or other tissues. MTH1 inhibition also had an alleviating role in disease models of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. We further identified a novel MTH1\n              low\n              ROS\n              low\n              phenotype among activated T cells. Regarding OGG1, we demonstrated a mechanism of action of the OGG1 inhibitor TH5487, which prevents the assembly of pro‐inflammatory transcription factors and mitigates acute airway infection in mouse models of pneumonia. Hence, we propose both enzymes to be promising novel targets to treat inflammation and suggest that redox and DNA repair pathways could be useful targets for future immunomodulating therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Karsten","given":"Stella"}],"citation-key":"karstenTargetingDNARepair2022","container-title":"Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology","container-title-short":"Basic Clin Pharma Tox","DOI":"10.1111/bcpt.13765","ISSN":"1742-7835, 1742-7843","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"en","page":"95-103","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Targeting the DNA repair enzymes MTH1 and OGG1 as a novel approach to treat inflammatory diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcpt.13765","volume":"131"},{"id":"kashekeFingolimodAttenuatesGait2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kasheke","given":"Gracious D.S."},{"family":"Holman","given":"Scott P."},{"family":"Robertson","given":"George S."}],"citation-key":"kashekeFingolimodAttenuatesGait2022","container-title":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","container-title-short":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jneuroim.2022.577926","ISSN":"01655728","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"en","page":"577926","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fingolimod attenuates gait deficits in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165572822001217","volume":"370"},{"id":"kashekeSelectiveRetinoidReceptor2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            Evidence that myelin repair is crucial for functional recovery in multiple sclerosis (MS) led to the identification of bexarotene (BXT). This clinically promising remyelinating agent activates multiple nuclear hormone receptor subtypes implicated in myelin repair. However, BXT produces unacceptable hyperlipidemia. In contrast, IRX4204 selectively activates the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Given compelling links between RXR activation and increased myelin repair, we employed IRX4204 to investigate the impact of RXR agonism alone on functional recovery in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Since gait deficits are common in MS, we used machine learning to obtain highly sensitive and reliable measurements of sagittal hindleg joint movements for mice walking on a treadmill. IRX4204 not only blocked the progressive loss of knee and ankle movements but also reversed joint movement impairments in EAE mice. Our biochemical, transcriptional and histological measurements in spinal cord suggest these gait improvements reflect increased axon survival and remyelination and reduced inflammation. Using microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, we present additional data suggesting that IRX4204 may act on multiple glial subtypes to orchestrate myelin repair. These results inform the discovery of restorative neural therapeutics for MS by demonstrating that selective RXR agonism is sufficient for effective myelin repair.

Clinical studies have explored the potential mechanism of action (MOA) and outcomes of GA immunization in patients. Furthermore, results from these and animal studies suggest that GA has a direct immunomodulatory effect on adaptive and innate immune cell phenotypes and responses. These MOAs have been postulated to have a common neuroprotective impact in several neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, several clinical studies report that the use of GA mitigated MS-associated cognitive decline. Its propensity to ameliorate neuro-proinflammatory and degenerative processes ignites increased interest in potential alternate uses such as in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Preclinical studies are exploring less frequent subcutaneous administration of GA, such as once weekly or monthly or a single dosing regimen. Indeed, cognitive functions were found to be either preserved, reversed, or improved after the less frequent treatment regimens with GA in animal models of AD. In this systematic review, we examine the potential novel uses of GA across clinical and pre-clinical studies, with evidence for its beneficial impact on cognition.

Since multiple sclerosis, the most common demyelinating disease, predominates in women, and androgen effects were reported to diverge according to sex, it seemed essential to assess the existence of such cooperation in females. Here, we developed an intranasal formulation containing the Hedgehog signaling agonist SAG, either alone or in combination with testosterone. We show that SAG promotes myelin regeneration and presumably a pro-regenerative phenotype of microglia, thus mimicking the effects previously observed in males. However, unlike in males, the combined molecules failed to cooperate in the demyelinated females, as shown by the level of functional improvement observed. Consistent with this observation, SAG administered in the absence of testosterone amplified peripheral inflammation by presumably activating NK cells and thus counteracting a testosterone-induced reduction in Th17 cells when the molecules were combined. Altogether, the data uncover a sex-dependent effect of the Hedgehog signaling agonist SAG on the peripheral innate immune system that conditions its ability to cooperate or not with androgens in the context of demyelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kassoussi","given":"Abdelmoumen"},{"family":"Zahaf","given":"Amina"},{"family":"Hutteau-Hamel","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Mattern","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Schumacher","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Bobé","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Traiffort","given":"Elisabeth"}],"citation-key":"kassoussiSmoothenedAgonistSAG2024","container-title":"Cells","container-title-short":"Cells","DOI":"10.3390/cells13080676","ISSN":"2073-4409","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,13]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"676","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Smoothened agonist SAG Modulates the Male and Female Peripheral Immune Systems Differently in an Immune Model of Central Nervous System Demyelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/13/8/676","volume":"13"},{"id":"kastamoniEffectsFatGraft2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kastamoni","given":"Menekşe"},{"family":"Yavaş","given":"Senem Esin"},{"family":"Ozgenel","given":"Güzin Yesim"},{"family":"Ersoy","given":"Semiha"}],"citation-key":"kastamoniEffectsFatGraft2023","container-title":"Revista da Associação Médica Brasileira","container-title-short":"Rev.

METHODS: We undertook a 10-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in 135 randomized subjects with MS and overactive bladder (OAB). RESULTS: The primary endpoint was the reduction in daily number of urinary incontinence episodes from baseline to end of treatment (8 weeks). Other endpoints included incidence of nocturia and urgency, overall bladder condition (OBC), daytime frequency, Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL), Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and volume voided. The primary endpoint showed little difference between Sativex and placebo. Four out of seven secondary endpoints were significantly in favour of Sativex: number of episodes of nocturia (adjusted mean difference -0.28, p = 0.010), OBC (-1.16, p = 0.001), number of voids/day (-0.85, p = 0.001) and PGIC (p = 0.005).

CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary endpoint did not reach statistical significance, we conclude that Sativex did have some impact on the symptoms of overactive bladder in patients with MS, providing evidence of some improvement in symptoms associated with bladder dysfunction in these subjects.","author":[{"literal":"Kavia R B"},{"literal":"De Ridder D"},{"literal":"Constantinescu C S"},{"literal":"Stott C G"},{"literal":"Fowler C J"}],"citation-key":"kaviarbRandomizedControlledTrial2010","container-title":"Mult Scler","DOI":"10.1177/1352458510378020","ISSN":"1352-4585","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"1349-59","title":"Randomized controlled trial of Sativex to treat detrusor overactivity in multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458510378020","volume":"16"},{"id":"kazemiThymoquinoneImprovesExperimental2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kazemi","given":"Roya"},{"family":"Yazdanpanah","given":"Esmaeil"},{"family":"Esmaeili","given":"Seyed-Alireza"},{"family":"Yousefi","given":"Bahman"},{"family":"Baharlou","given":"Rasoul"},{"family":"Haghmorad","given":"Dariush"}],"citation-key":"kazemiThymoquinoneImprovesExperimental2024","container-title":"Molecular Biology Reports","container-title-short":"Mol Biol Rep","DOI":"10.1007/s11033-023-09148-z","ISSN":"0301-4851, 1573-4978","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12]]},"language":"en","page":"256","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Thymoquinone improves experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by regulating both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11033-023-09148-z","volume":"51"},{"id":"keramatzadehEffectsResveratrolSupplementation2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Keramatzadeh","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Hosseini","given":"Seyed Ahmad"},{"family":"Majdinasab","given":"Nastaran"},{"family":"Cheraghian","given":"Bahman"},{"family":"Zilaee","given":"Marzie"}],"citation-key":"keramatzadehEffectsResveratrolSupplementation2024","container-title":"Nutritional Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Nutritional Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1080/1028415X.2024.2425649","ISSN":"1028-415X, 1476-8305","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,20]]},"language":"en","page":"1-9","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of resveratrol supplementation on inflammatory markers, fatigue scale, fasting blood sugar and lipid profile in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients: a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial","title-short":"Effects of resveratrol supplementation on inflammatory markers, fatigue scale, fasting blood sugar and lipid profile in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1028415X.2024.2425649"},{"id":"kerkeringIPSCderivedReactiveAstrocytes2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kerkering","given":"Janis"},{"family":"Muinjonov","given":"Bakhrom"},{"family":"Rosiewicz","given":"Kamil S."},{"family":"Diecke","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Biese","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Schiweck","given":"Juliane"},{"family":"Chien","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Zocholl","given":"Dario"},{"family":"Conrad","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Friedemann"},{"family":"Alisch","given":"Marlen"},{"family":"Siffrin","given":"Volker"}],"citation-key":"kerkeringIPSCderivedReactiveAstrocytes2023","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","DOI":"10.1172/JCI164637","ISSN":"1558-8238","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,3]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"e164637","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"iPSC-derived reactive astrocytes from patients with multiple sclerosis protect cocultured neurons in inflammatory conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jci.org/articles/view/164637","volume":"133"},{"id":"kesikburunNoninvasiveBrainStimulation2022","abstract":"Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been seen more common in rehabilitation settings.

As an add-on therapy to conventional rehabilitative treatments, the main goal of NIBS is to create neuromodulation by inhibiting or activating neural activity in the targeted cortical region. Indications for therapeutic NIBS in neurorehabilitation are motor recovery, aphasia, neglect, dysphagia, cognitive disorders, spasticity, and central pain.

It has been demonstrated that several genetic and epigenetic factors control autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of MS, through CD4+ T-cell population quantity. Alterations in the gut microbiota influence neuroprotectiveness via unexplored mechanisms. In this study, the ameliorative effect of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens fermented in camel milk (BEY) on an autoimmune-mediated neurodegenerative model using myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein/complete fraud adjuvant/pertussis toxin (MCP)-immunized C57BL6j mice is investigated. Anti-inflammatory activity was confirmed in the in vitro cell model, and inflammatory cytokines interleukins IL17 (from EAE 311 to BEY 227 pg/mL), IL6 (from EAE 103 to BEY 65 pg/mL), IFNγ (from EAE 423 to BEY 243 pg/mL) and TGFβ (from EAE 74 to BEY 133 pg/mL) were significantly reduced in BEY-treated mice. The epigenetic factor miR-218-5P was identified and confirmed its mRNA target SOX-5 using in silico tools and expression techniques, suggesting SOX5/miR-218-5p could serve as an exclusive diagnostic marker for MS. Furthermore, BEY improved the short-chain fatty acids, in particular butyrate (from 0.57 to 0.85 µM) and caproic (from 0.64 to 1.33 µM) acids, in the MCP mouse group. BEY treatment significantly regulated the expression of inflammatory transcripts in EAE mice and upregulated neuroprotective markers such as neurexin (from 0.65- to 1.22-fold) (p < 0.05), vascular endothelial adhesion molecules (from 0.41- to 0.76-fold) and myelin-binding protein (from 0.46- to 0.89-fold) (p < 0.03). These findings suggest that BEY could be a promising clinical approach for the curative treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and could promote the use of probiotic food as medicine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Khalifa","given":"Ashraf"},{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Hairul Islam Mohamed"},{"family":"Sheikh","given":"Abdullah"},{"family":"Khalil","given":"Hany Ezzat"}],"citation-key":"khalifaProbioticFermentedCamelMilk2023","container-title":"Pharmaceuticals","container-title-short":"Pharmaceuticals","DOI":"10.3390/ph16030357","ISSN":"1424-8247","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,25]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"357","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Probiotic-Fermented Camel Milk Attenuates Neurodegenerative Symptoms via SOX5/miR-218 Axis Orchestration in Mouse Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/16/3/357","volume":"16"},{"id":"khalifelooDryNeedlingTreatment2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Khalifeloo","given":"Maede"},{"family":"Naghdi","given":"Soofia"},{"family":"Ansari","given":"Noureddin Nakhostin"},{"family":"Dommerholt","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Sahraian","given":"Mohammad Ali"}],"citation-key":"khalifelooDryNeedlingTreatment2022","container-title":"Physiotherapy Theory and Practice","container-title-short":"Physiotherapy Theory and Practice","DOI":"10.1080/09593985.2021.1978118","ISSN":"0959-3985, 1532-5040","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,18]]},"language":"en","page":"3248-3254","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dry needling for the treatment of muscle spasticity in a patient with multiple sclerosis: a case report","title-short":"Dry needling for the treatment of muscle spasticity in a patient with multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09593985.2021.1978118","volume":"38"},{"id":"khanCannabinoidEndocannabinoidSystem2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Khan","given":"Hina"},{"family":"Ghori","given":"Fareeha Khalid"},{"family":"Ghani","given":"Uzma"},{"family":"Javed","given":"Aneela"},{"family":"Zahid","given":"Saadia"}],"citation-key":"khanCannabinoidEndocannabinoidSystem2022","container-title":"Molecular Biology Reports","container-title-short":"Mol Biol Rep","DOI":"10.1007/s11033-022-07223-5","ISSN":"0301-4851, 1573-4978","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6]]},"language":"en","page":"5117-5131","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cannabinoid and endocannabinoid system: a promising therapeutic intervention for multiple sclerosis","title-short":"Cannabinoid and endocannabinoid system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11033-022-07223-5","volume":"49"},{"id":"khandiaRecentAdvancesStem2024","abstract":"Neurodegeneration refers to the gradual loss of neurons and extensive changes in glial cells like tau inclusions in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, α-synuclein inclusions in oligodendrocytes and SOD1 aggregates in astrocytes along with deterioration in the motor, cognition, learning, and behavior. Common neurodegenerative disorders are Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), and supranuclear palsy. There is a lack of effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and scientists are putting their efforts into developing therapies against them. Stem cell therapy has emerged as a hope for neurodegenerative disorders since it is not only the damaged neurons that might be replaced, but other neuromodulators and neuroprotectors are secreted. Stem cell terminal differentiation before implantation ensures the implantation of correct cells and molecular markers like carbonic anhydrase II, CNPase (2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphohydrolase), myelin basic protein (MBP), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) elucidate the differentiation. Secretion of various growth factors like epidermal growth factor (EGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), vascular endothelial growth factor-α (VEGF-α), transforming growth factor (TGF), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) supports cell survival, cell proliferation, blood vessel formation, axon regeneration, and neuroglial functional connection formation at the site of degeneration. Adverse effects of stem cell therapy, like teratogenicity and differentiation in different cells other than the desired one under the influence of microenvironment, are a few key concerns. Post-transplantation improved synaptic plasticity, apoptosis inhibition, and reduction in tau-phosphorylation and amyloid beta (Aβ) production has been observed in Alzheimer’s patients. A large number of experimental, preclinical, and clinical studies have been conducted, and encouraging results have been obtained.

A comprehensive literature search, following PRSIMA guidelines was performed on MEDLINE, Wiley Cochrane, Scopus, and EBSCO databases, to identify and include articles recommending practices, frameworks or guidelines for AI procurement, integration, monitoring, and evaluation. From the included articles, data regarding study aim, use of a framework, rationale of the framework, details regarding AI implementation involving procurement, integration, monitoring, and evaluation were extracted. The extracted details were then mapped on to the Donabedian Plan, Do, Study, Act cycle domains. The search yielded 17,537 unique articles, out of which 47 were evaluated for inclusion based on their full texts and 25 articles were included in the review. Common themes extracted included transparency, feasibility of operation within existing workflows, integrating into existing workflows, validation of the tool using predefined performance indicators and improving the algorithm and/or adjusting the tool to improve performance. Among the four domains (Plan, Do, Study, Act) the most common domain was Plan (84%, n = 21), followed by Study (60%, n = 15), Do (52%, n = 13), & Act (24%, n = 6). Among 172 authors, only 1 (0.6%) was from a low-income country (LIC) and 2 (1.2%) were from lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Healthcare professionals cite the implementation of AI tools within clinical settings as challenging owing to low levels of evidence focusing on integration in the Do and Act domains.

Currently, there is an urgent demand for the discovery of novel anti-inflammatory drugs with potent activity but also safe for long-term application. Toward this aim, the present study reported the design, synthesis, and characterization of a set of novel 1,3-disubstituted-2-thiohydantoins derivatives. The anti-inflammatory activity of synthesized compounds was assessed against murine leukemia cell line (RAW264.7) by evaluating the cytotoxicity activity and their potency to prevent nitric oxide (NO) production. The results revealed that the synthesized compounds possess a considerable cytotoxic activity together with the ability to reduce the NO production in murine leukemia cell line (RAW264.7). Among synthesized compounds, compound 7 exhibited the most potent cytotoxic activity with IC50 of 197.68 μg/mL, compared to celecoxib drug (IC50 value 251.2 μg/mL), and demonstrated a significant ability to diminish the NO production (six-fold reduction). Exploring the mode of action responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity revealed that compound 7 displays a significant and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β. Furthermore, compound 7 demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α at 50 μg/mL, as compared to Celecoxib. Finally, detailed molecular modelling studies indicated that compound 7 exhibits a substantial binding affinity toward the binding pocket of the cyclooxygenase 2 enzyme. Taken together, our study reveals that 1,3-disubstituted-2-thiohydantoin could be considered as a promising scaffold for the development of potent anti-inflammatory agents.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Khirallah","given":"Salma M."},{"family":"Ramadan","given":"Heba M.

Stem cell transplantation for neuron regeneration is a promising strategic treatment for SCI. However, selecting stem cell sources and cell transplantation based on experimental evidence is required. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of combination cell transplantation using the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) over-expressing engineered mesenchymal stem cell (BDNF-eMSC) and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neuron progenitor cell (iMNP) in a chronic SCI rat model.\n            \n            \n              Method\n              A contusive chronic SCI was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats.

It is proposed to compromise cerebrovascular integrity, potentially leading to brain damage, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that pulse pressure affects cognition by disrupting white matter microstructure, and that it does so independently of other cardiovascular risk factors.METHODS Indices of pulse pressure, overall blood pressure and heart rate variability were estimated in a cross-sectional population-based cohort (n=708, aged 18-88 years). An indicator of white matter microstructure was derived from diffusion-weighted imaging, termed the “peak width of skeletonised mean diffusivity” (PSMD). Cognitive function was assessed using measures of processing speed.RESULTS In robust multiple linear regressions, pulse pressure significantly predicted PSMD. We also found that PSMD significantly predicted processing speed. Thus higher pulse pressure was associated with greater white matter disruption, and greater white matter disruption was associated with slower processing abilities.This motivated testing whether PSMD mediates the effects of pulse pressure on processing speed. We tested this using a number of structural equation models. PSMD significantly and substantially mediated the effect of pulse pressure on processing speed, over and above age and other cardiovascular factors. We then expanded the model to show that vascular-related changes in processing speed in turn drive changes in higher cognitive functions.CONCLUSIONS High pulse pressure disrupts microstructural integrity of white matter in the brain, leading to slower processing speed. We propose that better manament of pulse pressure could help to preserve white matter integrity and reduce cognitive decline in later life.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementCam-CAN was supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Grant BB/H008217/1.

If many firms use the same algorithm, even if it is more accurate than the alternatives, the resulting “monoculture” may be susceptible to correlated failures, much as a monocultural system is in biological settings. To investigate this concern, we develop a model of selection under monoculture. We find that even without any assumption of shocks or correlated failures—i.e., under “normal operations”—the quality of decisions may decrease when multiple firms use the same algorithm. Thus, the introduction of a more accurate algorithm may decrease social welfare—a kind of “Braess’ paradox” for algorithmic decision-making.\n          , \n            As algorithms are increasingly applied to screen applicants for high-stakes decisions in employment, lending, and other domains, concerns have been raised about the effects of algorithmic monoculture, in which many decision-makers all rely on the same algorithm. This concern invokes analogies to agriculture, where a monocultural system runs the risk of severe harm from unexpected shocks. Here, we show that the dangers of algorithmic monoculture run much deeper, in that monocultural convergence on a single algorithm by a group of decision-making agents, even when the algorithm is more accurate for any one agent in isolation, can reduce the overall quality of the decisions being made by the full collection of agents. Unexpected shocks are therefore not needed to expose the risks of monoculture; it can hurt accuracy even under “normal” operations and even for algorithms that are more accurate when used by only a single decision-maker.

Spasticity does not fully respond to standard treatment in one-third of the patients. OBJECTIVE: Our systematic review and meta-analysis assessed whether add-on nabiximols, can improve MS-associated refractory spasticity. METHODS: The systematic literature search was performed in Web of Science, MEDLINE, Scopus, CENTRAL, and Embase, on 15/10/2021, without restrictions. We included in the review blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of nabiximols in adult MS patients with refractory spasticity, by comparison with placebo. The primary outcome was responder rate by spasticity numerical rating scale (NRS). Secondary outcomes were spasticity-related parameters. We used random effect models to calculate odds ratios (OR) or mean differences and the corresponding 95% CI. Bias-factors were assessed with Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2). (PROSPERO ID: CRD42021282177). RESULTS: We identified 9 eligible articles, of which 7 (1128 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The spasticity numerical rating scale (NRS) was significantly higher in the nabiximols group than in the placebo group (OR 2.41 (95% CI 1.39; 4.18)). Secondary outcomes were in accordance with our primary results. At least some concerns were detected in the risk of bias analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that nabiximols is efficient in MS associated spasticity, refractory to standard treatment and it may be considered as add-on symptomatic therapy. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to establish the optimal treatment protocol - dose, duration, moment of initiation, disease type.","author":[{"literal":"Kleiner D"},{"literal":"Horváth I L"},{"literal":"Bunduc S"},{"literal":"Gergő D"},{"literal":"Lugosi K"},{"literal":"Fehérvári P"},{"literal":"Hegyi P"},{"literal":"Csupor D"}],"citation-key":"kleinerdNabiximolsEfficientAddon2023","container-title":"Curr Neuropharmacol","DOI":"10.2174/1570159X21666230727094431","ISSN":"1570-159x","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"2505-2515","title":"Nabiximols is efficient as add-on treatment for patients with multiple sclerosis spasticity refractory to standard treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2174/1570159X21666230727094431","volume":"21"},{"id":"kleinPersistencePersistentIdentifiers2020","abstract":"Scholarly resources, just like any other resources on the web, are subject to reference rot as they frequently disappear or significantly change over time.

DATA SOURCES: PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global databases were searched. METHODS: We included studies from database inception until 31 December 2021 involving adult participants diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or disseminated sclerosis, which featured quantitative data regarding the impact of relaxation interventions on multiple sclerosis-related symptoms and sequelae. Studies which examined multi-modal therapies - relaxation delivered in combination with non-relaxation interventions - were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Risk of Bias tool for randomised trials - ROB2, Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions ROBINS-I), and within and between-group effects were calculated (Hedges' g). RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty-three of these were randomised controlled trials, with 1246 total participants. This review reports on this data, with non-randomised study data reported in supplemental material. Post -intervention relaxation was associated with medium to large effect-size improvement for depression, anxiety, stress and fatigue. The effects of relaxation were superior to wait-list or no treatment control conditions; however, comparisons with established psychological or physical therapies were mixed. Individual studies reported sustained effects (≤ 6 months) with relaxation for stress, pain and quality of life. Most studies were rated as having a high/serious risk of bias. CONCLUSION: There is emerging evidence that relaxation therapies can improve outcomes for persons with multiple sclerosis. Given the high risk of bias found for included studies, stronger conclusions cannot be drawn.","author":[{"literal":"Kneebone II"},{"literal":"Van Zanden B E"},{"literal":"Dorstyn D S"},{"literal":"Roberts R M"},{"literal":"Lord S R"},{"literal":"Querstret D"},{"literal":"Theadom A"},{"literal":"Kennedy D S"},{"literal":"Raman J"},{"literal":"Nair R D"}],"citation-key":"kneeboneiiRelaxationRelatedTherapies2022","container-title":"Clin Rehabil","DOI":"10.1177/02692155221091509","ISSN":"0269-2155","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"883-899","title":"Relaxation and related therapies for people with multiple sclerosis (MS): A systematic review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/02692155221091509","volume":"36"},{"id":"knibbsMetaSecretlyTrained","abstract":"One of the most important AI copyright legal battles just took a major turn.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Knibbs","given":"Kate"}],"citation-key":"knibbsMetaSecretlyTrained","container-title":"Wired","ISSN":"1059-1028","language":"en-US","section":"tags","source":"www.wired.com","title":"Meta Secretly Trained Its AI on a Notorious Piracy Database, Newly Unredacted Court Docs Reveal","type":"article-magazine","URL":"https://www.wired.com/story/new-documents-unredacted-meta-copyright-ai-lawsuit/"},{"id":"knudsenBloodbrainBarrierPermeability2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Knudsen","given":"Maria Højberg"},{"family":"Lindberg","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Frederiksen","given":"Jette Lautrup"},{"family":"Vestergaard","given":"Mark Bitsch"},{"family":"Simonsen","given":"Helle Juhl"},{"family":"Varatharaj","given":"Aravinthan"},{"family":"Galea","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Blinkenberg","given":"Morten"},{"family":"Sellebjerg","given":"Finn"},{"family":"Larsson","given":"Henrik Bo Wiberg"},{"family":"Cramer","given":"Stig Præstekjær"}],"citation-key":"knudsenBloodbrainBarrierPermeability2022","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2022.103891","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"language":"en","page":"103891","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Blood-brain barrier permeability changes in the first year after alemtuzumab treatment predict 2-year outcomes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034822003935","volume":"63"},{"id":"kocicaIntensiveCircuitClass2022","abstract":"Objective: Long-term physiotherapy is of considerable benefit to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have motor dysfunction or gait impairment.

In this study we aimed to test the effect of 12-week intensive circuit class therapy (ICT) on motor skills and fatigue in MS patients. Forty-six MS patients with mild to moderate disability were randomly assigned to those who underwent the ICT, or to the control group. The ICT patients exercised intensively one day per week on nine different stations with two experienced physiotherapists, the control group patients continued their routine daily exercise. Intensively exercising MS patients then improved significantly in the overall balance, gait and fatigue parameters, while there was no significant improvement in the control group. These findings indicate that ICT is an effective therapy for MS patients with gait, balance or fatigue problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kocica","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Kolcava","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Sladeckova","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Stourac","given":"Pavel"},{"family":"Vlckova","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Dosbaba","given":"Filip"},{"family":"Kratochvilova","given":"Jitka"},{"family":"Bednarik","given":"Josef"}],"citation-key":"kocicaIntensiveCircuitClass2022","container-title":"Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine","container-title-short":"JRM","DOI":"10.2340/jrm.v54.2027","ISSN":"1651-2081","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,29]]},"license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0","page":"jrm00267","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Intensive Circuit Class Therapy in Patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://medicaljournalssweden.se/jrm/article/view/2027","volume":"54"},{"id":"kohsPharmacologicalTargetingCoagulation2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kohs","given":"Tia C.

Current evidence suggests that the disruption of BSCB integrity after spinal cord injury can lead to secondary injuries such as spinal cord edema and excessive inflammatory response. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are effective anti-inflammatory cells that can inhibit neuroinflammation after spinal cord injury, and their infiltration after spinal cord injury exhibits the same temporal and spatial characteristics as the automatic repair of BSCB. However, few studies have assessed the relationship between Treg cells and spinal cord injury, emphasizing BSCB integrity. This study explored whether Treg affects the recovery of BSCB after SCI and the underlying mechanism. We confirmed that spinal cord angiogenesis and Treg cell infiltration occurred simultaneously after SCI. Furthermore, we observed significant effects on BSCB repair and motor function in mice by Treg cell knockout and overexpression. Subsequently, we demonstrated the presence and function of exosomes in vitro. In addition, we found that Treg cell-derived exosomes encapsulated miR-2861, and miR-2861 regulated the expression of vascular tight junction (TJs) proteins. The luciferase reporter assay confirmed the negative regulation of IRAK1 by miR-2861, and a series of rescue experiments validated the biological function of IRAKI in regulating BSCB. In summary, we demonstrated that Treg cell-derived exosomes could package and deliver miR-2861 and regulate the expression of IRAK1 to affect BSCB integrity and motor function after SCI in mice, which provides novel insights for functional repair and limiting inflammation after SCI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kong","given":"Guang"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Wu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Chenyu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Siming"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenbo"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiangjun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yongjie"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Jin"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Zhengshuai"}],"citation-key":"kongTregCellsderivedExosomes2023","container-title":"Journal of Nanobiotechnology","container-title-short":"J Nanobiotechnol","DOI":"10.1186/s12951-023-02089-6","ISSN":"1477-3155","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,4]]},"language":"en","page":"364","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Treg cells-derived exosomes promote blood-spinal cord barrier repair and motor function recovery after spinal cord injury by delivering miR-2861","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jnanobiotechnology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12951-023-02089-6","volume":"21"},{"id":"kormanMultimodalClusteringAnalysis2025","abstract":"Background Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) present substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity, impeding advances in diagnostic precision and personalised treatment.

The clusters were probed for validity and robustness and characterised by clinical features, polygenic risk scores (PRS) and gene expression pathways.Results We successfully replicated gray matter volume alterations in 30/33 regions, with approximately half showing significant cross-modal abnormalities. Thalamic dysfunction emerged as particularly prominent. Clustering identified five distinct SSD subgroups with divergent brain-symptom-genetics profiles. Most notably, one subgroup exhibited pronounced white matter decline with aberrant neuroinflammation and myelin gene expression, while another subgroup showed increased gray matter volumes and elevated PRS for intracranial volume, even exceeding levels in our healthy controls.Conclusion These findings highlight the relevance of analyzing meta-analytically validated regions across multiple imaging modalities. Our clustering approach successfully identified neurobiologically distinct SSD subgroups, offering a promising framework for addressing the challenge of heterogeneity in severe mental illness and advancing precision psychiatry.Competing Interest StatementPF received speaker fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, Janssen, Otsuka, Lundbeck, Recordati, and Richter and was a member of the advisory boards of these companies and Rovi.

Here, we found that miR-145-5p is overabundant uniquely in chronic lesion tissues from secondary progressive MS patients. We induced both acute and chronic demyelination in miR-145 knockout mice to determine its contributions to remyelination failure. Following acute demyelination, no advantage to miR-145 loss could be detected. However, after chronic demyelination, animals with miR-145 loss demonstrated increased remyelination and functional recovery, coincident with altered presence of astrocytes and microglia within the corpus callosum relative to wild-type animals. This improved response in miR-145 knockout animals coincided with a pathological upregulation of miR-145-5p in wild-type animals with chronic cuprizone exposure, paralleling human chronic lesions. Furthermore, miR-145 overexpression specifically in oligodendrocytes (OLs) severely stunted differentiation and negatively impacted survival. RNAseq analysis showed altered transcriptome in these cells with downregulated major pathways involved in myelination. Our data suggest that pathological accumulation of miR-145-5p is a distinctive feature of chronic demyelination and is strongly implicated in the failure of remyelination, possibly due to the inhibition of OL differentiation together with alterations in other glial cells. This is mirrored in chronic MS lesions, and thus miR-145-5p serves as a potential relevant therapeutic target in progressive forms of MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kornfeld","given":"Samantha F."},{"family":"Cummings","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Yaworski","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"De Repentigny","given":"Yves"},{"family":"Gagnon","given":"Sabrina"},{"family":"Zandee","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Fathi","given":"Samaneh"},{"family":"Prat","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Kothary","given":"Rashmi"}],"citation-key":"kornfeldLossMiR145Promotes2024","container-title":"Communications Biology","container-title-short":"Commun Biol","DOI":"10.1038/s42003-024-06513-x","ISSN":"2399-3642","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,4]]},"language":"en","page":"813","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Loss of miR-145 promotes remyelination and functional recovery in a model of chronic central demyelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06513-x","volume":"7"},{"id":"koskaCaseReportSuccessful2021","abstract":"The Marburg variant of multiple sclerosis (Marburg MS) is the most aggressive form of MS, often leading to death soon after onset.

A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kosmyna","given":"Nataliya"},{"family":"Hauptmann","given":"Eugene"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Ye Tong"},{"family":"Situ","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Xian-Hao"},{"family":"Beresnitzky","given":"Ashly Vivian"},{"family":"Braunstein","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Maes","given":"Pattie"}],"citation-key":"kosmynaYourBrainChatGPT2025","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2506.08872","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,11]]},"number":"arXiv:2506.08872","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task","title-short":"Your Brain on ChatGPT","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872"},{"id":"Kotler","citation-key":"Kotler","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,28]]},"title":"Philip kotler","type":"document","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philip_Kotler&oldid=908241880"},{"id":"Kotler2019","author":[{"family":"Kotler'","given":"`Philip"}],"citation-key":"Kotler2019","issue":"brunoamaral","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7]]},"title":"In *Wikipedia*","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philip_Kotler&oldid=908241880>","volume":"28"},{"id":"kouchakiEffectsCrocinInflammatory2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kouchaki","given":"Ebrahim"},{"family":"Rafiei","given":"Hossein"},{"family":"Ghaderi","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Azadchehr","given":"Mohammad-Javad"},{"family":"Safa","given":"Fateme"},{"family":"Omidian","given":"Kosar"},{"family":"Khodabakhshi","given":"Adeleh"},{"family":"Vahid","given":"Farhad"},{"family":"Rezapoor-Kafteroodi","given":"Bahador"},{"family":"Banafshe","given":"Hamid-Reza"},{"family":"Safa","given":"Nasim"}],"citation-key":"kouchakiEffectsCrocinInflammatory2024","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2024.105454","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3]]},"language":"en","page":"105454","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of crocin on inflammatory biomarkers and mental health status in patients with multiple sclerosis: A randomized, double-blinded clinical trial","title-short":"Effects of crocin on inflammatory biomarkers and mental health status in patients with multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034824000336","volume":"83"},{"id":"krakenesNeuroprotectivePotentialMesenchymal2023","abstract":"Introduction\n              Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, and axonal degeneration within the central nervous system (CNS), for which there is no current treatment available with the ability to promote neuroprotection or remyelination.

Although remyelination is thought to protect axons, endogenous regenerative processes are often incomplete or fail entirely in many MS patients. While the precise reasons for remyelination failure remain unclear, repeated demyelination in previously affected white matter regions is a recognized contributing factor. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the sphingosine-1-phosphate modulator Siponimod ameliorates metabolic oligodendrocyte injury in an MS animal model. In this study, we explored the potential of Siponimod to enhance remyelination in a non-supportive environment. To this end, male mice were subjected to Cuprizone intoxication for seven weeks. From the onset of the fifth week, when oligodendrocyte progenitor cells begin to differentiate, mice were administered either a vehicle or Siponimod solution. Post-treatment, brain specimens were processed for (immune-) histochemical analyses. After four weeks of Cuprizone intoxication, staining intensities for various myelination markers, were significantly reduced. At the end of week seven, loss of myelin staining intensities was still pronounced, but anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) expression was significantly higher in Siponimod- versus vehicle-treated mice. Consistent with this finding, densities of OLIG2\n              +\n              oligodendrocytes significantly recovered in Siponimod-treated but not in vehicle-treated mice. This enhanced recovery was paralleled by the trend of lower densities of Ki67\n              +\n              proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.

The endocannabinoid system comprises canna-binoid receptors CB1 and CB2, which belong to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). CB1 recep-tors are primarily located on nerve terminals, prohibiting neurotransmitter release, whereas CB2 are present predominantly on immune cells, causing cytokine release. The activation of CB system con-tributes to the development of several diseases which might have lethal consequences, such as CNS disorders, cancer, obesity, and psychotic disorders on human health. Clinical evidence revealed that CB1 receptors are associated with CNS ailments such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and multiple sclerosis, whereas CB2 receptors are primarily connected with immune disorders, pain, inflammation, etc. Therefore, cannabinoid receptors have been proved to be promising targets in therapeutics and drug discovery. Experimental and clinical outcomes have disclosed the success sto-ry of CB antagonists, and several research groups have framed newer compounds with the binding potential to these receptors. In the presented review, we have summarized variously reported heter-ocycles with CB receptor agonistic/antagonistic properties against CNS disorders, cancer, obesity, and other complications. The structural activity relationship aspects have been keenly described along with enzymatic assay data. The specific outcomes of molecular docking studies have also been highlighted to get insights into the binding patterns of the molecules to CB receptors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Ankush"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Ojasvi"},{"family":"Bhatia","given":"Rohit"},{"family":"Monga","given":"VikramDeep"}],"citation-key":"kumarImpactCannabinoidReceptors2023","container-title":"Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry","container-title-short":"CTMC","DOI":"10.2174/1568026623666230502120956","ISSN":"15680266","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7]]},"language":"en","page":"1807-1834","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Impact of Cannabinoid Receptors in the Design of Therapeutic Agentsagainst Human Ailments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.eurekaselect.com/216424/article","volume":"23"},{"id":"kumarpodderInjectableShearthinningHydrogels2024","abstract":"Cell therapy for the treatment of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis is hampered by poor survival of donor oligodendrocyte cell preparations, resulting in limited therapeutic outcomes.

Urban (family Apiaceae) (C. asiatica) is a traditional botanical medicine used in aging and dementia. Water extracts of C. asiatica (CAW) have been used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in related animal models and are associated with increases in antioxidant response element (ARE) genes and improvements in mitochondrial respiratory function and neuronal health. Because multiple sclerosis (MS) shares its neurogenerative pathology of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction with aging and dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms in MS may also benefit from C. asiatica. To determine whether CAW similarly benefits neuropsychiatric symptoms, ARE gene expression, and mitochondrial respiration in inflammatory models of MS, and to determine the effects of CAW on clinical disability and inflammation, we tested CAW using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Methods: C57BL/6J mice induced with EAE were treated with CAW or a placebo for 2 weeks. The outcomes were clinical disability, signs of anxiety (open field test), ARE gene expression, mitochondrial respiration, and inflammation and demyelination. Results: At the dosing schedule and concentrations tested, CAW-treated mice with EAE demonstrated increased ARE gene expression and mitochondrial respiratory activity compared to those of placebo-treated mice with EAE. CAW was also associated with reduced inflammatory infiltrates in the spinal cord, but the differences between the populations of activated versus quiescent microglia were equivocal. CAW did not improve behavioral performance, EAE motor disability, or demyelination.

Reduced NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome complex assembly and Caspase-1 activation confirmed the drug’s mode of action. MOG35–55 EAE mice showed clinical signs of MS, but MOG35–55 EAE mice treated with tonabersat retained behavior closer to normal.

Primary outcomes were safety and tolerability of TUDCA, and exploratory outcomes included changes in clinical, laboratory and gut microbiome parameters.\n          \n          \n            Results\n            In the observational cohort, higher primary bile acid levels at baseline predicted slower whole brain, brain substructure and specific retinal layer atrophy. In the clinical trial, 47 participants were included in our analyses (21 in placebo arm, 26 in TUDCA arm). Adverse events did not significantly differ between arms (p=0.77). The TUDCA arm demonstrated increased serum levels of multiple bile acids. No significant differences were noted in clinical or fluid biomarker outcomes. Central memory CD4+ and Th1/17 cells decreased, while CD4+ naïve cells increased in the TUDCA arm compared to placebo. Changes in the composition and function of gut microbiota were also noted in the TUDCA arm compared to placebo.\n          \n          \n            Conclusion\n            Bile acid metabolism in MS is linked with brain and retinal atrophy. TUDCA supplementation in PMS is safe, tolerable and has measurable biological effects that warrant further evaluation in larger trials with a longer treatment duration.\n          \n          \n            Trial registration\n            \n              ClinicalTrials.gov\n              NCT03423121\n            \n          \n          \n            Funding\n            National MS Society grant RG-1707-28601 to PB, R01 NS082347 from NINDS to PAC and National MS Society grant RG-1606-08768 to SS.\n          \n          \n            Abstract Figure","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ladakis","given":"Dimitrios C."},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Kimystian L."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Solem","given":"Krista"},{"family":"Gadani","given":"Sachin"},{"family":"Jank","given":"Larissa"},{"family":"Hwang","given":"Soonmyung"},{"family":"Farhadi","given":"Farzaneh"},{"family":"Dewey","given":"Blake E."},{"family":"Fitzgerald","given":"Kathryn C."},{"family":"Sotirchos","given":"Elias S."},{"family":"Saidha","given":"Shiv"},{"family":"Calabresi","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Bhargava","given":"Pavan"}],"citation-key":"ladakisBileAcidMetabolites2024","DOI":"10.1101/2024.01.17.24301393","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,21]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Neurology","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bile acid metabolites predict multiple sclerosis progression and supplementation is safe in progressive disease","type":"article","URL":"http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2024.01.17.24301393"},{"id":"laeeqPotentialRoleFecal2023","abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects millions of people worldwide, and recent data have identified the potential role of the gut microbiome in inducing autoimmunity in MS patients.

At baseline, Tot-OxyAUC during walking was significantly increased in MS patients compared to healthy people and was significantly higher for those with more severe disabilities; it was also inversely correlated with physical performance. After rehabilitation, significant opposite variations in Tot-OxyAUC were observed, with activity levels being increased after OW and decreased after RAGT (+242,080 ± 361,902 and −157,031 ± 172,496 arbitrary units, respectively; p = 0.002), particularly in patients who were trained at a lower speed.

The provision of adequate pain relief to these patients can very difficult. Here we report the first phase III placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of the endocannabinoid system modulator delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/cannabidiol (CBD) oromucosal spray (USAN name, nabiximols; Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals, Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK), to alleviate CNP. Patients who had failed to gain adequate analgesia from existing medication were treated with THC/CBD spray or placebo as an add-on treatment, in a double-blind manner, for 14 weeks to investigate the efficacy of the medication in MS-induced neuropathic pain. This parallel-group phase of the study was then followed by an 18-week randomized-withdrawal study (14-week open-label treatment period plus a double-blind 4-week randomized-withdrawal phase) to investigate time to treatment failure and show maintenance of efficacy. A total of 339 patients were randomized to phase A (167 received THC/CBD spray and 172 received placebo). Of those who completed phase A, 58 entered the randomized-withdrawal phase. The primary endpoint of responder analysis at the 30 % level at week 14 of phase A of the study was not met, with 50 % of patients on THC/CBD spray classed as responders at the 30 % level compared to 45 % of patients on placebo (p = 0.234). However, an interim analysis at week 10 showed a statistically significant treatment difference in favor of THC/CBD spray at this time point (p = 0.046). During the randomized-withdrawal phase, the primary endpoint of time to treatment failure was statistically significant in favor of THC/CBD spray, with 57 % of patients receiving placebo failing treatment versus 24 % of patients from the THC/CBD spray group (p = 0.04). The mean change from baseline in Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (p = 0.028) and sleep quality NRS (p = 0.015) scores, both secondary endpoints in phase B, were also statistically significant compared to placebo, with estimated treatment differences of -0.79 and 0.99 points, respectively, in favor of THC/CBD spray treatment. The results of the current investigation were equivocal, with conflicting findings in the two phases of the study. While there were a large proportion of responders to THC/CBD spray treatment during the phase A double-blind period, the primary endpoint was not met due to a similarly large number of placebo responders. In contrast, there was a marked effect in phase B of the study, with an increased time to treatment failure in the THC/CBD spray group compared to placebo. These findings suggest that further studies are required to explore the full potential of THC/CBD spray in these patients.","author":[{"literal":"Langford R M"},{"literal":"Mares J"},{"literal":"Novotna A"},{"literal":"Vachova M"},{"literal":"Novakova I"},{"literal":"Notcutt W"},{"literal":"Ratcliffe S"}],"citation-key":"langfordrmDoubleblindRandomizedPlacebocontrolled2013","container-title":"J Neurol","DOI":"10.1007/s00415-012-6739-4","ISSN":"0340-5354","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"984-97","title":"A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of THC/CBD oromucosal spray in combination with the existing treatment regimen, in the relief of central neuropathic pain in patients with multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-012-6739-4","volume":"260"},{"id":"langleyCriticalRoleAstrocyte2021","abstract":"Western-style diets cause disruptions in myelinating cells and astrocytes within the mouse CNS. Increased CD38 expression is present in the cuprizone and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models of demyelination and CD38 is the main nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD\n              +\n              )-depleting enzyme in the CNS. Altered NAD\n              +\n              metabolism is linked to both high fat consumption and multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we identify increased CD38 expression in the male mouse spinal cord following chronic high fat consumption, after focal toxin [lysolecithin (LL)]-mediated demyelinating injury, and in reactive astrocytes within active MS lesions. We demonstrate that CD38 catalytically inactive mice are substantially protected from high fat-induced NAD\n              +\n              depletion, oligodendrocyte loss, oxidative damage, and astrogliosis. A CD38 inhibitor, 78c, increased NAD\n              +\n              and attenuated neuroinflammatory changes induced by saturated fat applied to astrocyte cultures. Conditioned media from saturated fat-exposed astrocytes applied to oligodendrocyte cultures impaired myelin protein production, suggesting astrocyte-driven indirect mechanisms of oligodendrogliopathy. In cerebellar organotypic slice cultures subject to LL-demyelination, saturated fat impaired signs of remyelination effects that were mitigated by concomitant 78c treatment. Significantly, oral 78c increased counts of oligodendrocytes and remyelinated axons after focal LL-induced spinal cord demyelination. Using a RiboTag approach, we identified a unique\n              in vivo\n              brain astrocyte translatome profile induced by 78c-mediated CD38 inhibition in mice, including decreased expression of proinflammatory astrocyte markers and increased growth factors.

We demonstrate that restoring NAD\n              +\n              levels via genetic inactivation of CD38 can overcome these effects. Moreover, we show that therapeutic inactivation of CD38 can enhance myelin regeneration.

The stimulation of M03-13 cells with TNFα activates the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-kB) pathway, leading to an increase in superoxide ion, NOXs/DUOX2 and phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase (pERK) levels. In addition, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) stimulation induces caspase 8 activation and the cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). All these TNFα-induced effects are reversed by CGA. Furthermore, CGA induces a blockade of proliferation, driving cells to differentiation, resulting in increased mRNA levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), which are major markers of mature OLs. Overall, these data suggest that dietary supplementation with this polyphenol could play an important beneficial role in autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases such as MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"La Rosa","given":"Giuliana"},{"family":"Sozio","given":"Concetta"},{"family":"Pipicelli","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Raia","given":"Maddalena"},{"family":"Palmiero","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Santillo","given":"Mariarosaria"},{"family":"Damiano","given":"Simona"}],"citation-key":"larosaAntioxidantAntiInflammatoryProDifferentiative2023","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms242316731","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,24]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"16731","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Antioxidant, Anti-Inflammatory and Pro-Differentiative Effects of Chlorogenic Acid on M03-13 Human Oligodendrocyte-like Cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/23/16731","volume":"24"},{"id":"lassmannContributionNeuropathologyMultiple2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background and purpose\n              Neuropathology plays a major role in deciphering disease mechanisms in multiple sclerosis (MS).

In MS research, neuropathology has been essential in discriminating the disease from other inflammatory autoimmune or demyelinating diseases, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody‐associated disease (MOGAD). It defined the hallmark of chronic progressive disease in MS patients as slowly expanding tissue damage, which occurs not only within and around lesions but also in the normal appearing white and gray matter. It showed that these changes occur in the course of a tissue‐resident immune response within the central nervous system, involving tissue‐resident effector memory cells and plasma cells. Molecular studies in neuropathologically defined micro‐dissected MS lesions identified a cascade of oxidative injury, mitochondrial damage and subsequent virtual hypoxia as a major pathway of tissue injury in MS.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The results of these studies were highly relevant for the identification of potential therapeutic targets in MS patients and the design of pivotal clinical trials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lassmann","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"lassmannContributionNeuropathologyMultiple2022","container-title":"European Journal of Neurology","container-title-short":"Euro J of Neurology","DOI":"10.1111/ene.15360","ISSN":"1351-5101, 1468-1331","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"en","page":"2869-2877","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The contribution of neuropathology to multiple sclerosis research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ene.15360","volume":"29"},{"id":"lavayenNeuroprotectionCannabidiolAminoquinone2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lavayen","given":"Bianca P."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Changjun"},{"family":"Larochelle","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Tishko","given":"Ryland J."},{"family":"De Oliveira","given":"Antonio Carlos Pinheiro"},{"family":"Muñoz","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Candelario-Jalil","given":"Eduardo"}],"citation-key":"lavayenNeuroprotectionCannabidiolAminoquinone2023","container-title":"Neurochemistry International","container-title-short":"Neurochemistry International","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuint.2023.105508","ISSN":"01970186","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"en","page":"105508","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neuroprotection by the cannabidiol aminoquinone VCE-004.8 in experimental ischemic stroke in mice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0197018623000360","volume":"165"},{"id":"lazzara1a25dihydroxyvitaminD3Protects2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              \n                Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy characterized by loss of function and death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), leading to irreversible vision loss.

There have been advancements in the symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis, including management of secondary multiple sclerosis expressions such as walking, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue and depression. Scientific evidence and expert opinion suggest that exercise may be the single most effective non-pharmacological symptomatic treatment for multiple sclerosis. This article presents the historical context of exercise training within the multidisciplinary management of multiple sclerosis. We guide neurologists and healthcare providers on the recommended prescription of exercise and practical, theoretical methods to overcome barriers to exercise. Method: We undertook a critical search of the historical and current literature regarding exercise and multiple sclerosis from the viewpoint of exercise promotion by neurologists and the multidisciplinary care team. Results: We highlight the ever-strengthening body of research indicating that exercise is safe and effective for improving symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Further, exercise training may be necessary for reducing disease progression. Conclusion: We seek to encourage neurologists and specialists in multidisciplinary healthcare teams to prescribe and promote exercise at diagnosis and across all stages of the disease trajectory using prescriptive guidelines as part of comprehensive MS care. Available tools include clinical education to dispel any historical myths related to exercise in multiple sclerosis, clinical exercise guidelines and behaviour change theory to overcome patients barriers to exercise.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Learmonth","given":"Yvonne Charlotte"},{"family":"Motl","given":"Robert Wayne"}],"citation-key":"learmonthExerciseTrainingMultiple2021","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","container-title-short":"IJERPH","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph182413245","ISSN":"1660-4601","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,16]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"13245","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Exercise Training for Multiple Sclerosis: A Narrative Review of History, Benefits, Safety, Guidelines, and Promotion","title-short":"Exercise Training for Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/24/13245","volume":"18"},{"id":"Lecture1overviewImc","abstract":"An Overview of Integrated Marketing Communications            Dr. George Belch     San Diego State University Communication-Based Marketing Model             ...","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,29]]},"citation-key":"Lecture1overviewImc","language":"en","title":"Lecture 1-overview of imc","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.slideshare.net/vmccvietnam/lecture-1overview-of-imc"},{"id":"Lee2018","author":[{"family":"Lee'","given":"`Ivy"}],"citation-key":"Lee2018","issue":"brunoamaral","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"title":"In *Wikipedia*","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ivy_Lee&oldid=873453098>","volume":"13"},{"id":"leeEmpiricalInvestigationImpact2024","abstract":"This paper investigates the potential of ChatGPT for helping humans tackle problems that require creativity.

We found that using ChatGPT increased the creativity of the generated ideas compared with not using any technology or using a conventional Web search (Google). This effect remained robust regardless of whether the problem required consideration of many (versus few) constraints and whether it was viewed as requiring empathetic concern.

Here, we profiled 832,505 human myeloid cells from the prefrontal cortex of 1,607 unique donors covering the human lifespan and varying degrees of AD neuropathology. We delineated 13 transcriptionally distinct myeloid subtypes organized into 6 subclasses and identified AD-associated adaptive changes in myeloid cells over aging and disease progression. The GPNMB subtype, linked to phagocytosis, increased significantly with AD burden and correlated with polygenic AD risk scores. By organizing AD-risk genes into a regulatory hierarchy, we identified and validated MITF as an upstream transcriptional activator of GPNMB, critical for maintaining phagocytosis. Through cell-to-cell interaction networks, we prioritized APOE-SORL1 and APOE-TREM2 ligand-receptor pairs, associated with AD progression. In both human and mouse models, TREM2 deficiency disrupted GPNMB expansion and reduced phagocytic function, suggesting that GPNMB’s role in neuroprotection was TREM2-dependent. Our findings clarify myeloid subtypes implicated in aging and AD, advancing the mechanistic understanding of their role in AD and aiding therapeutic discovery.Competing Interest StatementFJT consults for Immunai Inc., Singularity Bio B.V., CytoReason Ltd, Omniscope Ltd, Cellarity, and has ownership interests in Dermagnostix GmbH and Cellarity.

Microglia are innate immune cells that can acquire a regenerative phenotype to promote remyelination, yet little is known about the regulators controlling the regenerative microglia activation. Herein, using a cuprizone (CPZ)-diet induced de- and remyelination mice model, we identify PRMT1 as a driver for MHC-associated microglia population required for remyelination in the central nervous system. The loss of PRMT1, but not PRMT5, in microglia resulted in impairment of the remyelination with a reduction of oligoprogenitor cell number and prolonged microgliosis and astrogliosis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found eight distinct microglial clusters during the CPZ diet, and PRMT1 depleted microglia hindered the formation of the MHC-associated cluster, expressing MHCII and CD11c. Mechanistically, PRMT1-KO microglia displayed reduced the H3K27ac peaks at the promoter regions of the MHC- and IFN-associated genes and further suppressed gene expression during CPZ diet. Overall, our findings demonstrate that PRMT1 is a critical regulator of the MHC- and IFN-associated microglia, necessary for central nervous system remyelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Jeesan"},{"family":"Villarreal","given":"Oscar David"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yu Chang"},{"family":"Ragoussis","given":"Jiannis"},{"family":"Rivest","given":"Serge"},{"family":"Gosselin","given":"David"},{"family":"Richard","given":"Stéphane"}],"citation-key":"leePRMT1RequiredGeneration2022","container-title":"Life Science Alliance","container-title-short":"Life Sci.

Twenty patients under 36 months of age, admitted to the NICU/PICU or suspected of having rapidly progressive genetic disorders, were enrolled. Trio-based genome sequencing was performed using an optimized processing pipeline, which automatically performed mapping, variant calling, annotation, and in silico pathogenicity assessment. Among 20 enrolled patients, 11 (55%) were from the NICU, and 16 (80%) presented with neurological manifestations as their chief complaint. The median time from symptom onset to study enrollment was 73 days for 18 patients referred from other hospitals and less than a week for 2 in-hospital patients. The median turnaround time (TAT) for rWGS was 10 days, with the shortest being 5 days. A definite or presumed genetic diagnosis was made in 11 patients (55%), including 10 of 16 with neurological symptoms (62.5%) and 1 of 4 with non-neurologic symptoms (25%). Management plans were modified for 8 of the 11 patients (72.7%), including medication changes, diet modifications, and preimplantation genetic testing for future pregnancies. This study highlights the feasibility and clinical utility of WGS in critically ill pediatric patients in Korea, demonstrating a high diagnostic yield and significant impact on patient management, particularly among those presenting with neurologic symptoms. Establishing a nationwide fast-track system and providing detailed testing indications are required for effective implementation. Further automation and resource optimization could reduce the TAT and improve the efficacy of rWGS in critical care settings.Competing Interest StatementOne of the authors, Koh JY is an executive at Inocras.

The lack of appropriate neutralizing antibodies recognizing IL-2RG has made it difficult to thoroughly interrogate the role of γc cytokines in inflammatory and autoimmune disease settings. Here, we generated a γc cytokine receptor antibody, REGN7257, to determine whether γc cytokines might be targeted for T cell–mediated disease prevention and treatment. Biochemical, structural, and in vitro analysis showed that REGN7257 binds with high affinity to IL-2RG and potently blocks signaling of all γc cytokines. In nonhuman primates, REGN7257 efficiently suppressed T cells without affecting granulocytes, platelets, or red blood cells. Using REGN7257, we showed that γc cytokines drive T cell–mediated disease in mouse models of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and multiple sclerosis by affecting multiple aspects of the pathogenic response. We found that our xenogeneic GVHD mouse model recapitulates hallmarks of acute and chronic GVHD, with T cell expansion/infiltration into tissues and liver fibrosis, as well as hallmarks of immune aplastic anemia, with bone marrow aplasia and peripheral cytopenia. Our findings indicate that γc cytokines contribute to GVHD and aplastic anemia pathology by promoting these characteristic features.

Cuprizone(CPZ) induces demyelination in the central nervous system and its use has established a demyelination sheath animal model which is particularly suitable for studying the effects of BM-MSCs on the remyelination and mood improvement of a demyelinating model mice. Methods: 70 C57BL/6 male mice were selected and divided into 4 groups: the normal control (n = 20), chronic demyelination (n = 20), myelin repair (n = 15) and cell-treated groups (n = 15). Mice in the normal control group were given a normal diet; the chronic demyelination group mice were given a 0.2% CPZ mixed diet for 14 weeks, mice in the myelin repair and cell-treated groups mice were given a 0.2% CPZ diet for 12 weeks and normal diet for 2 weeks, while the cell-treated group mice were injected with BM-MSCs from the 13th week. The cuprizone-induced demyelination model was successfully established and BM-MSCs extracted, behavioural changes of the mice were detected by open field test, elevated plus maze test and tail suspension test, demyelination and repair of the corpus callosum and astrocyte changes were observed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy and the concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolites detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemistry (HPLC-ECD). Results: Results suggest BM-MSCs were successfully extracted and cultured, and migrated to the demyelinating area of brain tissue after cell transplantation. Compared with the normal control group, the mice in the chronic demyelination group showed obvious anxiety and depression behaviours (p < 0.05); compared with the chronic demyelination group, the anxiety and depression behaviours of the cell-treated group mice were improved (p < 0.05); compared with the normal control group, the demyelination of the corpus callosum region of the chronic demyelination group mice was significant (p < 0.01), while the myelin sheath of the cell-treated and myelin repair groups was repaired when compared with the chronic demyelination group (p < 0.05), and the cell-treated group had a more significant effect than the myelin repair group (p < 0.05). Compared with the normal control group, the number of astrocytes in the corpus callosum of the chronic demyelination group mice was significantly increased (p < 0.01), and the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the cell-treated group was lower than that in the chronic demyelination and myelin repair groups (p < 0.05); the serum concentrations of norepinephrine (NE), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-Hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) between the normal control and the chronic demyelination groups were significantly different (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The CPZ-induced model can be used as an experimental carrier for MS combined with anxiety and depression, and BM-MSC transplantation promotes the repair of myelin sheath and the recovery of emotional disorders in the model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lei","given":"Chu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Haowei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Kangning"}],"citation-key":"leiEffectsBoneMarrow2023","container-title":"Journal of Integrative Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

Recent studies on schizophrenia have highlighted the involvement of inflammatory and immunoregulatory mechanisms with the onset of symptoms, and the usage of anti-inflammatory treatments are being tested against periods of rapid psychosis. In the central nervous system, microglia are the innate immune population which are activated in response to a wide range of physical and psychological stress factors and produce proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines. Microglial activation and neuroinflammation has been associated to numerous psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, especially during psychotic episodes. Thus, novel treatments which dampen microglial activation may be of great relevance in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Fingolimod (FTY720) is a drug used as an immunosuppressive treatment to multiple sclerosis. Recent clinical trials have focused on FTY720 as a treatment for the behavioral symptoms in schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms of Fingolimod in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia are not clear. In this study we use a recently developed neuroinflammatory psychosis model in mice: cuprizone short-term exposure, to investigate the effects of FTY720 administration. FTY720 administration was able to completely alleviate methamphetamine hypersensitivity caused by cuprizone exposure. Moreover, administration of FTY720 improved multiple measures of neuroinflammation (microglial activation, cytokine production, and leucocyte infiltration). In conclusion, our results highlight the future use of FTY720 as a direct anti-inflammatory treatment against microglial activation and psychosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Siyao"},{"family":"Sakurai","given":"Koki"},{"family":"Ohgidani","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Kato","given":"Takahiro A."},{"family":"Hikida","given":"Takatoshi"}],"citation-key":"liAmeliorativeEffectsFingolimod2023","container-title":"Molecular Brain","container-title-short":"Mol Brain","DOI":"10.1186/s13041-023-01047-5","ISSN":"1756-6606","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,12]]},"language":"en","page":"59","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ameliorative effects of Fingolimod (FTY720) on microglial activation and psychosis-related behavior in short term cuprizone exposed mice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-023-01047-5","volume":"16"},{"id":"liaoCausalAssociationMetformin2025","abstract":"Metformin has been shown to possess immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects in various animal and clinical studies.

However, it remains unclear whether CNS-associated NETs affect pain outcomes. A fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) alleviates neurological disorders by attenuating neuroinflammation and promoting nerve regeneration. Hence, in this study, we explore the role of NETs in the CNS during acute pain and investigate the role of FMD in inhibiting NETs and relieving pain.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The inflammatory pain model was established by injecting complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the hind paw of mice. The FMD diet regimen was performed during the perioperative period. PAD4 siRNA or CI-amidine (PAD4 inhibitor) was used to inhibit the formation of NETs. Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) knockdown occurred by AAV-GFAP-shRNA or AAV-hSyn-shRNA or was inhibited by selegiline (an MAO-B inhibitor). The changes in NETs, neuroinflammation, and related signaling pathways were examined by western blot, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and flow cytometry.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In the acute phase of inflammatory pain, NETs accumulate in the spinal cords of mice. This is associated with exacerbated neuroinflammation. Meanwhile, inhibition of NETs formation alleviates allodynia and neuroinflammation in CFA mice. FMD inhibits NETs production and alleviates inflammatory pain, which is enhanced by treatment with the NETs inhibitor CI-amidine, and reversed by treatment with the NETs inducer phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Mechanistically, the neutrophil-recruiting pathway MAO-B/5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) / G-protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35) and NETs-inducing pathway MAO-B/ Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are significantly upregulated during the development of inflammatory pain. MAO-B is largely expressed in astrocytes and neurons in the spinal cords of CFA mice. However, knockdown or inhibition of MAO-B effectively attenuates CFA-induced inflammatory pain, NETs formation, and neuroinflammation in the spinal cord. Moreover, within rescue experiments, MAO-B inhibitors synergistically enhance FMD-induced pain relief, NETs inhibition, and neuroinflammation attenuation, whereas supplementation with MAO-B downstream molecules (i.e., 5-HIAA and PMA) abolished this effect.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Neutrophil-released NETs in the spinal cord contribute to pain development.

Considering the side effects of the currently used anti-inflammatory medications, new therapeutic agents are urgently needed for the improvement of regenerative capacities of inflammatory-impaired tissues. Mesenchymal stromal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) are characterized by the capabilities of self-renewal and multipotent differentiation and exhibit immunomodulatory capacity. Due to the ability to modulate inflammatory phenotypes and immune responses, MSCs have been considered as a potential alternative therapy for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Natural compounds (NCs) are complex small multiple-target molecules mostly derived from plants and microorganisms, exhibiting therapeutic effects in many disorders, such as osteoporosis, diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. Recently, increasing studies focused on the prominent effects of NCs on MSCs, including the regulation of cell survival and inflammatory response, as well as osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation capacities, which indicate the roles of NCs on MSC-based cytotherapy in several inflammatory diseases. Their therapeutic effects and fewer side effects in numerous physiological processes, compared to chemosynthetic drugs, made them to be a new therapeutic avenue combined with MSCs for impaired tissue regeneration. Here we summarize the current understanding of the influence of NCs on MSCs and related downstream signaling pathways, specifically in pathological inflammatory conditions. In addition, the emerging concepts through the combination of NCs and MSCs to expand the therapeutic perspectives are highlighted.

At early time points post-hOM-MSC treatment, animals had reduced levels of circulating IL-16, which was reflected in both the ability of immune cells to secrete IL-16 and the level of IL-16 in spinal cord inflammatory lesions. Further in vitro investigation revealed an inhibitory role for IL-16 on oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Moreover, the availability of bioactive IL-16 after demyelination was reduced in the presence of hOM-MSCs. Combined, our data suggests that human hOM-MSCs may have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of MS via an IL-16-mediated pathway, especially if administered during active demyelination and inflammation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lindsay","given":"Susan L."},{"family":"Molęda","given":"Aleksandra M."},{"family":"MacLellan","given":"Lindsay M."},{"family":"Keh","given":"Siew Min"},{"family":"McElroy","given":"Daniel E."},{"family":"Linington","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Goodyear","given":"Carl S."},{"family":"Barnett","given":"Susan C."}],"citation-key":"lindsayHumanOlfactoryMesenchymal2022","container-title":"Acta Neuropathologica Communications","container-title-short":"acta neuropathol commun","DOI":"10.1186/s40478-022-01316-9","ISSN":"2051-5960","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"en","page":"12","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Human olfactory mesenchymal stromal cell transplantation ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis revealing an inhibitory role for IL16 on myelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-022-01316-9","volume":"10"},{"id":"lindsayLowSulfatedHeparan2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            There is an urgent need for therapies that target the multicellular pathology of central nervous system (CNS) disease.

LS‐mHep7 treatment had no effect on remyelination or on OLIG2 positive oligodendrocyte numbers within the corpus callosum in the cuprizone model. Further in vitro investigation confirmed that LS‐mHep7 likely mediates its pro‐repair effect in the EAE model by sequestering inflammatory cytokines, such as CCL5 which are upregulated during immune‐mediated inflammatory attacks.

Microglial/macrophage modulation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MS. Oxygen free radical accumulation can induce axonal and nerve cell damage, and further promote MS development. We created a new recombinant protein based on flagellin from\n              Legionella pneumophila\n              named flagellin A with linked\n              C\n              - and\n              N\n              -terminal ends (FLaAN/C), which is an independent intellectual property of our team.

Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of FLaAN/C on mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35–55 (MOG35-55). The mice were injected intraperitoneally with FLaAN/C after the onset of clinical symptoms, then clinical behavior scores and changes in body weight were recorded daily. The spinal lumbar spine in model mice was enlarged and accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination that were reversed by FLaAN/C. FLaAN/C also induced microglia/macrophages to generate less pro-inflammatory (CD86, iNOS, and TNF-α), and more anti-inflammatory (CD206, IL-10, and Arginase-1) cytokines. These findings suggesting that FLaAN/C promoted microglial/macrophages polarization from the inflammatory M1 to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Moreover, FLaAN/C inhibited release of the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6, IL-17, and IFN-γ. These results indicated that the anti-inflammatory effect of FLaAN/C was associated with the inhibited generation of reactive oxygen species. FLaAN/C downregulated the expression of phosphorylated NF-κB-p65 and prevented downstream NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. Collectively, these results indicated that FLaAN/C prevents pyroptosis by inhibiting the ROS/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway, and promotes the microglial/macrophage M1/M2 polarization that significantly alleviated inflammation in mouse models of EAE.

However, existing medications for multiple sclerosis were far from satisfactory due to their failure to suppress relapses and alleviate disease progression. Novel drug targets for multiple sclerosis prevention are still needed.\n            We performed Mendelian randomization to explore potential drug targets for multiple sclerosis using summary statistics from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (nCase = 47 429, nControl = 68 374) and further replicated in UK Biobank (nCase = 1356, nControl = 395 209) and FinnGen cohorts (nCase = 1326, nControl = 359 815). Genetic instruments for 734 plasma and 154 CSF proteins were obtained from recently published genome-wide association studies. The reverse causality detection using bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis and Steiger filtering, Bayesian co-localization, and phenotype scanning that searched previously reported genetic variant–trait associations were implemented to consolidate the Mendelian randomization findings further. In addition, the protein–protein interaction network was performed to reveal potential associations among proteins and/or present multiple sclerosis medications.\n            At Bonferroni significance (P &lt; 5.63 × 10−5), Mendelian randomization analysis revealed six protein–multiple sclerosis pairs. In plasma, per standard deviation increase in FCRL3, TYMP and AHSG had a protective effect. Odds ratios for the proteins above were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79–0.89), 0.59 (95% CI, 0.48–0.71) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83–0.94), respectively. In CSF, per 10-fold increase in MMEL1 (OR, 5.03; 95% CI, 3.42–7.41) increased the risk of multiple sclerosis, while SLAMF7 (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.29–0.60) and CD5L (OR, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.18–0.52) decreased the risk. None of the six proteins had reverse causality. Bayesian co-localization suggested that FCRL3 [coloc.abf-posterior probability of hypothesis 4 (PPH4) = 0.889], TYMP (coloc.susie-PPH4 = 0.896), AHSG (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.957, coloc.susie-PPH4 = 0.973), MMEL1 (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.930) and SLAMF7 (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.947) shared the same variant with multiple sclerosis. FCRL3, TYMP and SLAMF7 interacted with target proteins of current multiple sclerosis medications. MMEL1 was replicated in both UK Biobank and FinnGen cohorts.\n            Our integrative analysis suggested that genetically determined levels of circulating FCRL3, TYMP, AHSG, CSF MMEL1 and SLAMF7 had causal effects on multiple sclerosis risk.

All WMH and hippocampal subfield volumes were corrected for intracranial volumes to account for subject variability. Cognition was assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests. Pearson correlations and unpaired t-tests were performed to assess correlations and differences between hospitalized and non-hospitalized groups.Results We found similar WMH volume (4112 vs 3144mm³, p=0.2131), smaller hippocampal volume (11856 vs 12227mm³, p=0.0497) and lower cognitive and memory performance, especially the MoCA score (24.9 vs 26.4 pts, p=0.0084), duration completing trail making test B (97.6 vs 79.4 seconds, p=0.0285), Craft immediate recall (12.6 vs 16.4 pts, p&lt;0.0001), Craft delay recall (12.0 vs 15.6 pts, p=0.0001), and Benson figure copy (15.2 vs 16.1 pts, p=0.0078) in 52 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (19[37%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.1[7.4] years) compared with 111 age-matched non-hospitalized participants (66[59%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.5[8.4] years).Conclusions and Relevance Our results indicate that hospitalized COVID-19 cases show lower hippocampal volume when compared to non-hospitalized participants. We also show that WMH and hippocampal volumes correlate with worse cognitive scores in hospitalized patients compared with non-hospitalized participants, potentially indicating recent lesions and atrophy.Key Points Question: Do white matter hyperintensity burden, hippocampal whole and subfield volumes, and cognition differ between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 versus participants without hospitalization?Findings: We found no significant difference in white matter hyperintensity volume, but hippocampal volume was reduced, and cognitive and memory performance were worse in those hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with age-matched non-hospitalized group (either mild COVID-19 or no COVID-19 reported). In the hospitalized group, increased white matter hyperintensity and reduced hippocampal volumes are significantly higher correlated with worse cognitive and memory scores.Meaning: Adults hospitalized for COVID-19 had lower hippocampal volumes and worse cognitive performance than adults with COVID-19 that did not lead to hospitalization or without reported COVID-19 infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study is supported by National Institute on Aging - National Institutes of Health R56AG074467 (TI and SS) and in part by the University of Pittsburgh Center for Research Computing: RRID:SCR 022735, through the resources provided.

Multivariable MR (MVMR) was then conducted to adjust for 13 covariates, testing the robustness of findings.Results 25(OH)D showed a significant protective effect on MSA across all UVMR (both primary and replication) and MVMR analyses. It also exhibited a nominal protective effect on PD in the Finnish population in primary UVMR analysis, but this was not replicated. No associations were found between 25(OH)D and iRBD, PD onset age, PD clinical progression, or DLB. Power analyses indicated insufficient sensitivity to detect weak effects of 25(OH)D on iRBD and DLB.Conclusions MR analysis supports a protective role of 25(OH)D against MSA. While nominally protective for PD in the Finnish population, the effect was not robust. Weak effects on iRBD and DLB cannot be excluded.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (JCYJ20220818102206014), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82271454), the Futian Healthcare Research Project (FTWS2022010), the District Key Specialty Funds / Department of Neurology (QZDZK-202410), and the Hospital Key Discipline Funds / Department of Neurology (YZDXKJF-202017).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The GWAS data sources used in this study are detailed in the Methods section and Supplementary materials - Table S1.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

To date, limitations in current clinical treatment options can leave SCI patients with lifelong disabilities. There is an urgent need to develop new therapies for reconstructing the damaged spinal cord neuron-glia network and restoring connectivity with the supraspinal pathways. Neural stem cells (NSCs) possess the ability to self-renew and differentiate into neurons and neuroglia, including oligodendrocytes, which are cells responsible for the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath and the regeneration of demyelinated axons. For these properties, NSCs are considered to be a promising cell source for rebuilding damaged neural circuits and promoting myelin regeneration. Over the past decade, transplantation of NSCs has been extensively tested in a variety of preclinical models of SCI. This review aims to highlight the pathophysiology of SCI and promote the understanding of the role of NSCs in SCI repair therapy and the current advances in pathological mechanism, pre-clinical studies, as well as clinical trials of SCI via NSC transplantation therapeutic strategy. Understanding and mastering these frontier updates will pave the way for establishing novel therapeutic strategies to improve the quality of recovery from SCI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Chun"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Yuping"},{"family":"Li","given":"Siguang"}],"citation-key":"liRolesNeuralStem2024","container-title":"Stem Cell Research & Therapy","container-title-short":"Stem Cell Res Ther","DOI":"10.1186/s13287-024-03825-x","ISSN":"1757-6512","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,8]]},"language":"en","page":"204","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The roles of neural stem cells in myelin regeneration and repair therapy after spinal cord injury","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-024-03825-x","volume":"15"},{"id":"liShannonEntropyGray2025","abstract":"Background Current Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnostics rely on late-stage cognitive assessments or invasive biomarkers. Neuroimaging offers non-invasive alternatives, but single-modality approaches (structural atrophy or functional connectivity) face limitations in sensitivity and specificity for early detection. We introduce entropy and temperature, novel structure-function coupling (SFC) biomarkers based on gray matter eigenmodes, to quantify cortical disorganization in early AD.Methods We analyzed multimodal MRI (structural + resting-state fMRI) and amyloid-PET data from two independent cohorts (BABRI: N=135; ADNI: N=275), including cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD participants. We computed Shannon entropy by projecting fMRI time series onto individual structural eigenmodes, and temperature based on eigenmode-based reconstruction of functional connectivity. These indexes were evaluated for diagnostic classification (SVM), prediction of amyloid- β (A β) burden (regression), and stratification of MCI subtypes (reversed/stable/progressed).Results Entropy was significantly elevated in AD compared to CN and MCI participants across both cohorts (Δ=8-21%, p&lt;0.001), with left-hemisphere entropy showing superior diagnostic accuracy (AUC=0.901 for CN vs. MCI; AUC=0.873 for CN vs. AD). Right-hemisphere and global entropy robustly predicted Aβ deposition (error reduction: 38.7–42.1% vs. baseline, p&lt;0.01). Entropy stratified MCI into distinct subtypes: progressors (MCI→AD) showed higher entropy and Aβ than stable/reverted MCI (p&lt;0.001) and exhibited a biphasic entropy trajectory during conversion. Temperature indices did not show significant differences across diagnostic groups.Discussion Entropy derived from gray matter eigenmodes emerges as a sensitive and dual-purpose biomarker for AD diagnosis and pathological prediction. Its hemispheric asymmetry (left: optimal classification; right: Aβ prediction) and ability to detect nonlinear MCI progression offer mechanistic insights for early intervention.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by STI2030-Major Projects (2022ZD0211600), the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 32171085), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 12405062), State Key Program of National Natural Science of China (Grants No. 82130118), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Public welfare research institution (ZZ13-YQ-073, Z0601), Open Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning and Tang Scholar.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was conducted in accordance with the institutional review board (IRB) at the Imaging Center for Brain Research at Beijing Normal University (protocol code ICBIR_A_0041_002_02 and date of approval 03.2015).

Macrophage polarization plays an important role in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a traditional experimental model of multiple sclerosis. This study investigated the effect of Fasudil on macrophages and examined the therapeutic potential of Fasudil-modified macrophages in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We found that Fasudil induced the conversion of macrophages from the pro-inflammatory M1 type to the anti-inflammatory M2 type, as shown by reduced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide, interleukin-12, and CD16/32 and increased expression of arginase-1, interleukin-10, CD14, and CD206, which was linked to inhibition of Rho kinase activity, decreased expression of toll-like receptors, nuclear factor-κB, and components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, and generation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6. Crucially, Fasudil-modified macrophages effectively decreased the impact of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, resulting in later onset of disease, lower symptom scores, less weight loss, and reduced demyelination compared with unmodified macrophages. In addition, Fasudil-modified macrophages decreased interleukin-17 expression on CD4\n              +\n              T cells and CD16/32, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and interleukin-12 expression on F4/80\n              +\n              macrophages, as well as increasing interleukin-10 expression on CD4\n              +\n              T cells and arginase-1, CD206, and interleukin-10 expression on F4/80\n              +\n              macrophages, which improved immune regulation and reduced inflammation.

Previous research prioritized genes by integrating Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) results with tissue- level eQTLs. Recent studies have explored brain cell type-specific eQTLs, but they lack a systematic analysis across various Alzheimer’s disease (AD) GWAS datasets, nor did they compare effects between tissue and cell type levels or across different cell type-specific eQTL datasets. In this study, we integrated brain cell type-specific eQTL datasets with AD GWAS datasets to identify potential causal genes at the cell type level.Methods To prioritize disease-causing genes, we used Summary Data-Based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and Bayesian Colocalization (COLOC) to integrate AD GWAS summary statistics with cell-type-specific eQTLs. Combining data from five AD GWAS, three single-cell eQTL datasets, and one bulk tissue eQTL meta-analysis, we identified and confirmed both novel and known candidate causal genes. We investigated gene regulation through enhancer activity using H3K27ac and ATAC-seq data, performed protein-protein interaction and pathway enrichment analyses, and conducted a drug/compound enrichment analysis with the Drug Signatures Database (DSigDB) to support drug repurposing for AD.Results We identified 27 candidate causal genes for AD using cell type-specific eQTL datasets, with the highest numbers in microglia, followed by excitatory neurons, astrocytes, inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). PABPC1 emerged as a novel astrocyte-specific gene. Our analysis revealed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for these causal genes in microglia and astrocytes. We found the “regulation of aspartic-type peptidase activity” pathway being the most enriched among all the causal genes. AD-risk variants associated with candidate causal gene PABPC1 is located near or within enhancers only active in astrocytes. We classified the genes into three drug tiers and identified druggable interactions, with imatinib mesylate emerging as a key candidate. A drug-target gene network was created to explore potential drug targets for AD.Conclusions We systematically prioritized AD candidate causal genes based on cell type- specific molecular evidence. The integrative approach enhances our understanding of molecular mechanisms of AD-related genetic variants and facilitates the interpretation of AD GWAS results.Competing Interest StatementA.S. has received support from Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Eli Lilly (in kind contribution of PET tracer precursor) and participated in Scientific Advisory Boards (Bayer Oncology, Eisai, Novo Nordisk, and Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc) and an Observational Study Monitoring Board (MESA, NIH NHLBI), as well as several other NIA External Advisory Committees.

It is widely accepted that the level of intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor in human glaucoma, and reduction of IOP level is the principally most well‐known method to prevent cell death of RGCs. However, clinical studies show that lowering IOP fails to prevent RGC degeneration in the progression of glaucoma. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of glaucoma pathological process is required for developing new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we provide functional and histological evidence showing that optic nerve defects occurred before retina damage in an ocular hypertension glaucoma mouse model, in which oligodendroglial lineage cells were responsible for the subsequent neuropathology. By treatment with clemastine, an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved first‐generation antihistamine medicine, we demonstrate that the optic nerve and retina damages were attenuated via promoting oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and enhancing remyelination. Taken together, our results reveal the timeline of the optic neuropathies in glaucoma and highlight the potential role of oligodendroglial lineage cells playing in its treatment. Clemastine may be used in future clinical applications for demyelination‐associated glaucoma.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yujian"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Zhonghao"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Chunhui"},{"family":"Su","given":"Yixun"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Nanxin"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Haoqian"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Chenju"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Lan"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Jianqin"}],"citation-key":"liuRemyelinationorientedClemastineTreatment2024","container-title":"Glia","container-title-short":"Glia","DOI":"10.1002/glia.24543","ISSN":"0894-1491, 1098-1136","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1555-1571","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Remyelination‐oriented clemastine treatment attenuates neuropathies of optic nerve and retina in glaucoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/glia.24543","volume":"72"},{"id":"liuSec13PromotesOligodendrocyte2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhixiong"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Minbiao"},{"family":"Lei","given":"Wanying"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Rencai"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Wenxiu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jialin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chaomeng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Li"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Mei"},{"family":"Nian","given":"Ximing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Daopeng"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Di"},{"family":"Lv","given":"Xiaoqi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chaoying"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Changchuan"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Luming"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Caiming"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Jin"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Naian"},{"family":"Mo","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhanxiang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Liang"}],"citation-key":"liuSec13PromotesOligodendrocyte2022","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","DOI":"10.1172/JCI155096","ISSN":"1558-8238","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"e155096","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sec13 promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin repair through autocrine pleiotrophin signaling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jci.org/articles/view/155096","volume":"132"},{"id":"liuSmallmoleculeinducedEpigeneticRejuvenation2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Xuezhao"},{"family":"Xin","given":"Dazhuan Eric"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Xiaowen"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Chuntao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhidan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Liguo"},{"family":"Dourson","given":"Adam J."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Lindsay"},{"family":"Mishra","given":"Shreya"},{"family":"Bayat","given":"Arman E."},{"family":"Nicholson","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Seibel","given":"William L."},{"family":"Yan","given":"Bingfang"},{"family":"Mason","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Bradley J."},{"family":"Gonsalvez","given":"David G."},{"family":"Ong","given":"William"},{"family":"Chew","given":"Sing Yian"},{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Balaram"},{"family":"Yoon","given":"Sung Ok"},{"family":"Xin","given":"Mei"},{"family":"He","given":"Zhigang"},{"family":"Tchieu","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Wegner","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Nave","given":"Klaus-Armin"},{"family":"Franklin","given":"Robin J.M."},{"family":"Dutta","given":"Ranjan"},{"family":"Trapp","given":"Bruce D."},{"family":"Hu","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Matthew A."},{"family":"Jankowski","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Barton","given":"Samantha K."},{"family":"He","given":"Xuelian"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Q.

Although they affect millions of individuals around the world, only a limited number of effective treatment options are available today. Since most neurological disorders express mitochondria-related metabolic perturbations, metformin, a biguanide type II antidiabetic drug, has attracted a lot of attention to be repurposed to treat neurological disorders by correcting their perturbed energy metabolism. However, controversial research emerges regarding the beneficial/detrimental effects of metformin on these neurological disorders. Given that most neurological disorders have complex etiology in their pathophysiology and are influenced by various risk factors such as aging, lifestyle, genetics, and environment, it is important to identify perturbed molecular functions that can be targeted by metformin in these neurological disorders. These molecules can then be used as biomarkers to stratify subpopulations of patients who show distinct molecular/pathological properties and can respond to metformin treatment, ultimately developing targeted therapy. In this review, we will discuss mitochondria-related metabolic perturbations and impaired molecular pathways in these neurological disorders and how these can be used as biomarkers to guide metformin-responsive treatment for the targeted therapy to treat neurological disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Loan","given":"Allison"},{"family":"Syal","given":"Charvi"},{"family":"Lui","given":"Margarita"},{"family":"He","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jing"}],"citation-key":"loanPromisingUseMetformin2024","container-title":"Neural Regeneration Research","DOI":"10.4103/1673-5374.385286","ISSN":"1673-5374, 1876-7958","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5]]},"language":"en","page":"1045-1055","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Promising use of metformin in treating neurological disorders: biomarker-guided therapies","title-short":"Promising use of metformin in treating neurological disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/10.4103/1673-5374.385286","volume":"19"},{"id":"lockWhatAIChatbot2022","abstract":"The tool has impressed experts with its writing ability, proficiency at complex tasks and ease of use","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Lock","given":"Samantha"}],"citation-key":"lockWhatAIChatbot2022","container-title":"The Guardian","ISSN":"0261-3077","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,5]]},"language":"en-GB","section":"Technology","source":"The Guardian","title":"What is AI chatbot phenomenon ChatGPT and could it replace humans?","type":"article-newspaper","URL":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/05/what-is-ai-chatbot-phenomenon-chatgpt-and-could-it-replace-humans"},{"id":"loixStearoylCoADesaturase1Potential2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            Disturbances in the fatty acid lipidome are increasingly recognized as key drivers in the progression of various brain disorders.

Over the past years, it was established that inhibition or deficiency of SCD1 not only suppresses neuroinflammation but also protects against neurodegeneration in conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. This protective effect is achieved through different mechanisms including enhanced remyelination, reversal of synaptic and cognitive impairments, and mitigation of α-synuclein toxicity. Intriguingly, metabolic rerouting of fatty acids via SCD1 improves the pathology associated with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, suggesting context-dependent benign and harmful effects of SCD1 inhibition in the brain. Here, we summarize and discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying both the beneficial and detrimental effects of SCD1 in these neurological disorders. We explore commonalities and distinctions, shedding light on potential therapeutic challenges. Additionally, we touch upon future research directions that promise to deepen our understanding of SCD1 biology in brain disorders and potentially enhance the clinical utility of SCD1 inhibitors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Loix","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Vanherle","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Turri","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Kemp","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"Karl J.

The potential of cannabinoids includes add-on immunosuppressive, analgesic, neuroprotective, and remyelinative effects. This study evaluates the efficacy of medical marijuana in MS and its experimental animal models. A systematic review was conducted by a literature search through PubMed, ProQuest, and EBSCO electronic databases for studies reported since 2007 on the use of cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in MS and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD), and toxin-induced demyelination models. Study selection and data extraction were performed by 3 reviewers, and 28 studies were selected for inclusion. The certainty of evidence was appraised using the Cochrane GRADE approach. In clinical studies, there was low- and moderate-quality evidence that treatment with ~1:1 CBD/THC mixtures as a nabiximols (Sativex(®)) oromucosal spray reduced numerical rating scale (NRS) scores for spasticity, pain, and sleep disturbance, diminished bladder overactivity, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine and transcription factor expression levels. Preclinical studies demonstrated decreases in disease severity, hindlimb stiffness, motor function, neuroinflammation, and demyelination. Other experimental systems showed the capacity of cannabinoids to promote remyelination in vitro and by electron microscopy. Modest short-term benefits were realized in MS responders to adjunctive therapy with CBD/THC mixtures. Future studies are recommended to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of cannabinoid effects on MS lesions and to evaluate whether medical marijuana can accelerate remyelination and retard the accrual of disability over the long term.","author":[{"literal":"Longoria V"},{"literal":"Parcel H"},{"literal":"Toma B"},{"literal":"Minhas A"},{"literal":"Zeine R"}],"citation-key":"longoriavNeurologicalBenefitsClinical2022","container-title":"Biomedicines","DOI":"10.3390/biomedicines10030539","ISSN":"2227-9059 (Print) 2227-9059","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"title":"Neurological benefits, clinical challenges, and neuropathologic promise of medical marijuana: a systematic review of cannabinoid effects in multiple sclerosis and experimental models of demyelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines10030539","volume":"10"},{"id":"Lopes0000000330450304","abstract":"ORCID record for Lopes, A.

An increasing number of controlled studies have assessed the potential rehabilitative effects of new drug-free treatments, complementary to the standard care, including music-based therapy (MBT). OBJECTIVE: To analyze the evidence for the effectiveness of MBT within the therapeutic approaches to individuals diagnosed with MS. METHODS: A systematic review of clinical trials was performed with searches in the following databases: BIOSIS, CINAHL, Cochrane, EBSCO, ERIC, Google Scholar, IBECS, LILACS, LISA (ProQuest), Medline, PEDro, PsycINFO (APA), Psychological & Behavioral, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science. Clinical trials comparing MBT versus conventional therapy/no intervention were included. RESULTS: From the 282 studies identified, 10 trials were selected. Among these, the total sample consisted of 429 individuals: 253 were allocated to the experimental group (MBT) and 176 to the control group (conventional therapies or no intervention). All the studies presented high methodological quality. Modalities of MBT were clustered into four groups: (1) Rhythmic auditory; (2) Playing musical instruments; (3) Dance strategy; and (4) Neurological music therapy. Overall, the studies consistently showed that MBT was better than conventional therapy or no intervention, with regard to gait parameters (double support time and walking speed), fatigue level, fatigability, coordination, dexterity, balance, walking endurance, lower extremity functional strength, emotional status and pain. Regarding mental fatigability and memory, the data were conflicting and the evidence was unclear. CONCLUSION: MBT is a safe and effective approach for clinical rehabilitation of MS patients that leads to positive results regarding both motor and non-motor functions.","author":[{"literal":"Lopes J"},{"literal":"Keppers II"}],"citation-key":"lopesjMusicbasedTherapyRehabilitation2021","container-title":"Arq Neuropsiquiatr","DOI":"10.1590/0004-282X-ANP-2020-0374","ISSN":"0004-282x","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"527-535","title":"Music-based therapy in rehabilitation of people with multiple sclerosis: a systematic review of clinical trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1590/0004-282X-ANP-2020-0374","volume":"79"},{"id":"lopesMachineLearningApproach2023","abstract":"The medical field, as many others, is overwhelmed with the amount of research-related information available, such as journal papers, conference proceedings and clinical trials.

The systematic review was conducted using the MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science databases from inception to May 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting pre-post changes in fatigue after vitamin D supplementation were included.

The AD relevance of the discovered variants was explored using bulk RNA-seq data from caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal, and posterior cingulate cortex human brain tissues.Results Limbic WM microstructure demonstrated significant heritability (estimates between 0.26 and 0.60, pFDR &lt; 0.05 for 15 of 35 tract-by-microstructure combinations). GWAS identified 6 genome-wide significant loci (p &lt; 5.0×10−8) associated with WM microstructure. Notably, for MTG RDFWcorr, we identified a locus on chromosome 18 (lead SNP: rs12959877) comprising 38 SNPs that are eQTLs for CDH19, a gene involved in cell adhesion and highly expressed in oligodendrocytes. Other significant associations involved SNPs near KC6, SENP5, RORA, FAM107B, and MIR548A1. Bulk RNA-seq analyses revealed that brain tissue expression of RORA, FAM107B, and KC6 was significantly associated with cognitive decline and several AD pathologies (pFDR &lt; 0.05). Post-GWAS analyses identified the genes SERPINA12 and DNAJB14, and highlighted the involvement of insulin signaling, immune response, and neurotrophic pathways. Genetic covariance analyses indicated shared genetic architecture between limbic WM and lipid profiles (e.g., HDL cholesterol), cardiovascular traits, and neurological conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis) (pFDR &lt; 0.05).Conclusion This multi-cohort imaging genetics study identified several novel genes and biological pathways associated with limbic WM microstructure in an aging population enriched for cognitive impairment. The association of several identified genes with cognitive decline and AD pathology underscores their AD relevance. Our findings further suggest that the genetic underpinnings of limbic WM microstructure are linked to vascular health and inflammation, highlighting these pathways as promising avenues for future AD-related therapeutic development.Competing Interest StatementSCJ has served on advisory boards for Enigma Biomedical and ALZPath in the past two years.

Compared to MSCs themselves, MSC-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) have provided significant advantages by efficiently decreasing unfavorable adverse effects, such as infusion-related toxicities. MSC-Exos is becoming a promising cell-free therapeutic tool and an increasing number of clinical studies started to assess the therapeutic effect of MSC-Exos in different diseases. In this review, we summarized the ongoing and completed clinical studies using MSC-Exos for immunomodulation, regenerative medicine, gene delivery, and beyond. Additionally, we summarized MSC-Exos production methods utilized in these studies with an emphasis on MSCs source, MSC-Exos isolation methods, characterization, dosage, and route of administration.

APOE ε4 is well-known to increase the risk of dementia, and it has been shown to attenuate the protective association of fish oil supplementation and the incidence of dementia. To identify more genetic factors with similar modifying effects, we performed a genome-wide scan.Methods We first performed time-to-event genome-wide association study (GWAS) of all-cause dementia and two of its subtypes, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular dementia, in the UK Biobank. GWAS were performed in all participants (N = 357,631) and in two subgroups with or without fish oil supplementation (N = 113,267 and 244,364, respectively). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) suggestively associated with dementia were then evaluated for their interactions with fish oil status in Cox-regression models. Furthermore, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis to identify the relevant cell types for these interaction signals.Results Time-to-event GWAS identified 6, 5, and 2 genome-wide significant loci (p &lt; 5e-8) for the incidence of all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia, respectively. Most of them overlapped with previously known GWAS loci for AD and related dementia. A total of 178 suggestive GWAS loci (p &lt; 1e-5) were passed onto interaction analysis, and 43 of them were found to significantly modify the association between fish oil supplementation and dementia incidence (p &lt; 2.8e-4 with Bonferroni correction). One locus overlapped with a known AD GWAS locus (EED/PICALM) and two overlapped with GWAS loci for circulating omega-3 fatty acids (SRSF4, PSMG1). Gene set enrichment analysis found that candidate genes of interaction signals demonstrated tissue or cell-type specificity in the brain.Conclusion We identified 43 genetic loci that modify the association between fish oil supplementation and dementia. These findings indicate a need for genome-informed personalized nutrition of fish oil supplementation for the purpose of dementia prevention.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementResearch reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institute of Health under the award number R35GM143060 (KY).

The molecular mechanisms underlying astrocyte activation remain incompletely understood. Recent studies have suggested that classical neurotransmitter receptors are implicated in the modulation of brain innate immunity. We investigated the role of dopamine signaling in the process of astrocyte activation. Here, we show the upregulation of dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in reactive astrocytes in MS brain and noncanonical role of astrocytic DRD2 in MS pathogenesis. Mice deficient in astrocytic Drd2 exhibit a remarkable suppression of reactive astrocytes and amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mechanistically, DRD2 regulates the expression of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase, which modulates NF-κB activity through protein kinase C-δ. Pharmacological blockade of astrocytic DRD2 with a DRD2 antagonist dehydrocorybulbine remarkably inhibits the inflammatory response in mice lacking neuronal Drd2. Together, our findings reveal previously an uncharted role for DRD2 in astrocyte activation during EAE-associated CNS inflammation.

Multiple studies have reported CuATSM treatment provides therapeutic efficacy in various mouse models of ALS without any observable adverse effects. Moreover, recent results from an open label clinical study suggested that daily oral dosing with CuATSM slows disease progression in patients with both sporadic and familial ALS, providing encouraging support for CuATSM in the treatment of ALS.

Unexpectedly, we report a subset of mice initially administered CuATSM exhibited signs of clinical toxicity, that necessitated euthanasia in extremis after 3–51 days of treatment.

There is no cure for MS, and despite a significant improvement in the therapeutic management of patients during the last 20 years, some symptoms are still resistant to treatment, and the evolution of the disease to progressive form seems still ineluctable. The etiology of MS is complex and still not fully understood. However, inflammation is a major driver of physiopathology and oxidative stress contributes to CNS lesions and promotes existing inflammatory response. Plant polyphenols are endowed with many therapeutic benefits through alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation, thus providing neuroprotection in MS.

This process drives the pathophysiology of autoimmune chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS), multiple sclerosis (MS), leading to nerve cell damage and progressive neurodegeneration. Stimulating the reconstruction of damaged myelin sheaths is one of the goals in terms of delaying the progression of MS symptoms and preventing neuronal damage. Short, noncoding RNA molecules, microRNAs (miRNAs), responsible for regulating gene expression, are believed to play a crucial role in the remyelination process. For example, studies showed that miR-223 promotes efficient activation and phagocytosis of myelin debris by microglia, which is necessary for the initiation of remyelination. Meanwhile, miR-124 promotes the return of activated microglia to the quiescent state, while miR-204 and miR-219 promote the differentiation of mature oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, miR-138, miR-145, and miR-338 have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and assembly of myelin proteins. Various delivery systems, including extracellular vesicles, hold promise as an efficient and non-invasive way for providing miRNAs to stimulate remyelination.

Despite extensive research, much of EH heritability remains unexplained. We investigated the genetic basis of EH in African-derived individuals from partially isolated quilombo populations in Vale do Ribeira (SP-Brazil).Methods Samples from 431 individuals (167 affected, 261 unaffected, 3 unknown) were genotyped using a 650k SNP array. Estimated global ancestry proportions were 47% African, 36% European, and 16% Native American. We constructed six pedigrees using additional data from 673 individuals and created three non-overlapping SNP subpanels. We phased haplotypes and performed local ancestry analysis to account for admixture. Genome-wide linkage analysis (GWLA) and fine-mapping via family-based association studies (FBAS) were conducted, prioritizing EH-associated genes through systematic approach involving databases like PubMed, ClinVar, and GWAS Catalog.Results Linkage analysis identified 22 regions of interest (ROIs) with LOD scores ranging 1.45-3.03, encompassing 2,363 genes. Fine-mapping (FBAS) identified 60 EH-related candidate genes and 117 suggestive/significant variants. Among these, 14 genes, including PHGDH, S100A10, MFN2, and RYR2, were strongly related to hypertension harboring 29 suggestive/significant SNPs.Conclusions Through a complementary approach — combining admixture-adjusted GWLA based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, FBAS on known and imputed data, and gene prioritizing — new loci, variants, and candidate genes were identified. These findings provide targets for future research, replication in other populations, facilitate personalized treatments, and improve public health towards African-derived underrepresented populations. Limitations include restricted SNP coverage, self-reported pedigree data, and lack of available EH genomic studies on admixed populations for independent validation, despite the performed genetic correlation analyses using summary statistics.What Is New?This study applies a multi-level computational approach integrating admixture-adjusted genome-wide linkage analysis (GWLA), family-based association studies (FBAS), and fine-mapping strategies to investigate the genetic basis of essential hypertension (EH) in Brazilian Quilombo populations, a historically underrepresented group in genomic research.What Is Relevant?By focusing on admixed populations with high African ancestry, our findings address gaps in hypertension genetics by identifying 22 regions of interest (ROIs), 60 candidate genes, and 117 suggestive/significant variants, highlighting population-specific genetic factors that may contribute to EH risk. The study also emphasizes the need for ancestry-aware genomic analyses to improve the precision of genetic risk assessment in underrepresented populations.What Question Should Be Addressed Next?Future studies should focus on replicating these findings in independent admixed cohorts, conducting functional validation of prioritized genes, and integrating polygenic risk scores (PRS) adjusted for ancestry to enhance clinical applications for hypertension prevention and treatment in diverse populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe acknowledge funding from CEPID-FAPESP (Research Center on the Human Genome and Stem Cells, grants 1998/14254-2 and 2013/08028-1, and FAPESP/INCT-CNPq 2014/50931-3).

While a core strategy to understand the biological context of genes and proteins includes annotation enrichment analysis, such as Gene Ontology term enrichment, these methods are not well suited for analysing groups of TFs.

We evaluated the inference of downstream gene targets with respect to false positive annotations, and found an inference based on co-expression to best predict downstream processes. Based on these downstream genes, the TFTenricher uses some of the most common databases for gene functionalities, including GO, KEGG and Reactome, to calculate functional enrichments. By applying the TFTenricher to differential expression of TFs in 21 diseases, we found significant terms associated with disease mechanism, while the gene set enrichment analysis on the same dataset predominantly identified processes related to transcription.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions and availability\n              \n                The TFTenricher package enables users to search for biological context in any set of TFs and their downstream genes.

Demyelination can be healed through remyelination which is mediated by new oligodendrocytes derived from the adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Unfortunately, the efficiency of remyelination declines with progressive aging partially due to the depletion of OPCs following chronic or repeated demyelination. However, to our knowledge, so far there is no drug which enhances proliferation of OPCs, and it is unknown whether inhibiting RIPK1 activity directly affect OPCs, the central player of remyelination. Using TNFα induced RIPK1-dependent necroptosis in Jurkat FADD\n              −/−\n              cells as a cell death assay, we screened from 2112 FDA-approved drugs and the drug candidates of new RIPK1 inhibitors selected by ourselves, and identified ZJU-37, a small molecule modified by introducing an amide bond to Nec-1s, is a new RIPK1 kinase inhibitor with higher potency than Nec-1s which has the best reported potency. We unveil in addition to protecting myelin from demyelination and axons from degeneration, ZJU-37 exhibits a new role on promoting proliferation of OPCs and enhancing remyelination by inhibiting RIPK1 kinase activity with higher potency than Nec-1s. Mechanistically, ZJU-37 promotes proliferation of OPCs by enhancing the transcription of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha via NF-κB pathway. This work identifies ZJU-37 as a new drug candidate which enhances remyelination by promoting proliferation of OPCs, paving the way for a potential drug to enhance myelin repair.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Xiao-Ru"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Shu-Ying"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Shuang-Shuang"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Huan-Huan"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Hui-Min"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Fan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Zhao-Jun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Di-Xian"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Meng","given":"Xianhui"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Hong-Guang"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jing-Wei"}],"citation-key":"maInhibitionRIPK1ZJU372022","container-title":"Cell Death Discovery","container-title-short":"Cell Death Discov.","DOI":"10.1038/s41420-022-00929-2","ISSN":"2058-7716","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"147","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Inhibition of RIPK1 by ZJU-37 promotes oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation and remyelination via NF-κB pathway","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41420-022-00929-2","volume":"8"},{"id":"makarImmunomodulatoryTherapyGlatiramer2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are found in lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) and animal models of MS such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and may contribute to the neuronal loss that underlies permanent impairment.

Based on previous studies reporting that adiponectin exhibits neuroprotective effects in some models of neurodegenerative diseases, we analyzed the effects of AdipoRon treatment, alone or in combination with the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS (MS-CSF), to verify whether this adipokine acts on the basal neuronal cellular processes. To this aim, SH-SY5Y and U-87 cells (models of neuronal and glial cells, respectively) were exposed to MS-CSF alone or in co-treatment with AdipoRon. The cell viability was determined via MTT assay, and the possible underlying mechanisms were investigated via the alterations of oxidative stress and inflammation. MTT assay confirmed that AdipoRon alone did not affect the viability of both cell lines; whereas, when used in combination with MS-CSF, it reduces MS-CSF inhibitory effects on the viability of both SH-SY5Y and U-87 cell lines. In addition, MS-CSF treatment causes an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas it determines the reduction in anti-inflammatory IL-10. Interestingly, the co-administration of AdipoRon counteracts the MS-CSF-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas it determines an enhancement of IL-10. In conclusion, our data suggest that AdipoRon counteracts the cytotoxic effects induced by MS-CSF on SH-SY5Y and U-87 cell lines and that one of the potential molecular underlying mechanisms might occur via reduction in oxidative stress and inflammation. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are essential to confirm whether adiponectin could be a neuro-protectant candidate against neuronal cell injury.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mallardo","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Signoriello","given":"Elisabetta"},{"family":"Lus","given":"Giacomo"},{"family":"Daniele","given":"Aurora"},{"family":"Nigro","given":"Ersilia"}],"citation-key":"mallardoAdiponectinAlleviatesCell2023","container-title":"Biomedicines","container-title-short":"Biomedicines","DOI":"10.3390/biomedicines11061692","ISSN":"2227-9059","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1692","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Adiponectin Alleviates Cell Injury due to Cerebrospinal Fluid from Multiple Sclerosis Patients by Inhibiting Oxidative Stress and Proinflammatory Response","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/11/6/1692","volume":"11"},{"id":"mallucciEvidenceNovelCell2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mallucci","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Marchesi","given":"Nicoletta"},{"family":"Campagnoli","given":"Lucrezia Irene Maria"},{"family":"Boschi","given":"Federica"},{"family":"Fahmideh","given":"Foroogh"},{"family":"Fusco","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Tavazzi","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Govoni","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Bergamaschi","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Pascale","given":"Alessia"}],"citation-key":"mallucciEvidenceNovelCell2022","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2022.104197","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"en","page":"104197","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Evidence for novel cell defense mechanisms sustained by dimethyl fumarate in multiple sclerosis patients: the HuR/SOD2 cascade","title-short":"Evidence for novel cell defense mechanisms sustained by dimethyl fumarate in multiple sclerosis patients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034822007027","volume":"68"},{"id":"maMiR223EnhancesLipophagy2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Lipid droplet (LD)-laden microglia is a key pathological hallmark of multiple sclerosis. The recent discovery of this novel microglial subtype, lipid-droplet-accumulating microglia (LDAM), is notable for increased inflammatory factor secretion and diminished phagocytic capability. Lipophagy, the autophagy-mediated selective degradation of LDs, plays a critical role in this context. This study investigated the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in lipophagy during demyelinating diseases, assessed their capacity to modulate LDAM subtypes, and elucidated the potential underlying mechanisms involved.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              C57BL/6 mice were used for in vivo experiments. Two weeks post demyelination induction at cervical level 4 (C4), histological assessments and confocal imaging were performed to examine LD accumulation in microglia within the lesion site. Autophagic changes were observed using transmission electron microscopy. miRNA and mRNA multi-omics analyses identified differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs under demyelinating conditions and the related autophagy target genes. The role of miR-223 in lipophagy under these conditions was specifically explored. In vitro studies, including miR-223 upregulation in BV2 cells via lentiviral infection, validated the bioinformatics findings. Immunofluorescence staining was used to measure LD accumulation, autophagy levels, target gene expression, and inflammatory mediator levels to elucidate the mechanisms of action of miR-223 in LDAM.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Oil Red O staining and confocal imaging revealed substantial LD accumulation in the demyelinated spinal cord. Transmission electron microscopy revealed increased numbers of autophagic vacuoles at the injury site. Multi-omics analysis revealed miR-223 as a crucial regulatory gene in lipophagy during demyelination. It was identified that cathepsin B (CTSB) targets miR-223 in autophagy to integrate miRNA, mRNA, and autophagy gene databases. In vitro, miR-223 upregulation suppressed CTSB expression in BV2 cells, augmented autophagy, alleviated LD accumulation, and decreased the expression of the inflammatory mediator IL-1β.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              These findings indicate that miR-223 plays a pivotal role in lipophagy under demyelinating conditions.

Genetic or Ab-based neutralization of the IFNL receptor (IFNLR) resulted in lack of disease maintenance during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, with loss of CNS Th1 effector responses and limited axonal injury. Phenotypic effects of IFNLR signaling were traced to increased APC function, with associated increase in T cell production of IFN-γ and GM-CSF. Consistent with this, IFNL levels within lesions of CNS tissues derived from patients with MS were elevated compared with MS normal-appearing white matter. Furthermore, expression of IFNLR was selectively elevated in MS active lesions compared with inactive lesions or normal-appearing white matter.

Human amniotic fluid secretome is abundant in immunoregulatory factors, with extracellular vesicles (EVs) being a significant component. However, the impact of these EVs on dendritic cells subsets remain unexplored. In this study, we investigated the interaction between highly purified dendritic cell subsets and EVs derived from amniotic fluid stem cell lines (HAFSC‐EVs). Our results suggest that HAFSC‐EVs are preferentially taken up by conventional dendritic cell type 2 (cDC2) through CD29 receptor‐mediated internalization, resulting in a tolerogenic DC phenotype characterized by reduced expression and production of pro‐inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, treatment of cDC2 cells with HAFSC‐EVs in coculture systems resulted in a higher proportion of T cells expressing the regulatory T cell marker Foxp3 compared to vehicle‐treated control cells. Moreover, transfer of HAFSC‐EV‐treated cDC2s into an EAE mouse model resulted in the suppression of autoimmune responses and clinical improvement. These results suggest that HAFSC‐EVs may serve as a promising tool for reprogramming inflammatory cDC2s towards a tolerogenic phenotype and for controlling autoimmune responses in the central nervous system, representing a potential platform for the study of the effects of EVs in DC subsets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Manni","given":"Giorgia"},{"family":"Gargaro","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Ricciuti","given":"Doriana"},{"family":"Fontana","given":"Simona"},{"family":"Padiglioni","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Cipolloni","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Mazza","given":"Tommaso"},{"family":"Rosati","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Di Veroli","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Mencarelli","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Pieroni","given":"Benedetta"},{"family":"Silva Barcelos","given":"Estevão Carlos"},{"family":"Scalisi","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Sarnari","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Di Michele","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Pascucci","given":"Luisa"},{"family":"De Franco","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Zelante","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Antognelli","given":"Cinzia"},{"family":"Cruciani","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Talesa","given":"Vincenzo Nicola"},{"family":"Romani","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Fallarino","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"manniAmnioticFluidStem2024","container-title":"Journal of Extracellular Vesicles","container-title-short":"J of Extracellular Vesicle","DOI":"10.1002/jev2.12446","ISSN":"2001-3078, 2001-3078","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"e12446","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Amniotic fluid stem cell‐derived extracellular vesicles educate type 2 conventional dendritic cells to rescue autoimmune disorders in a multiple sclerosis mouse model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://isevjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jev2.12446","volume":"13"},{"id":"manousiIdentificationNovelMyelin2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Manousi","given":"Anastasia"},{"family":"Göttle","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Reiche","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Qiao-Ling"},{"family":"Healy","given":"Luke M."},{"family":"Akkermann","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Gruchot","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Schira-Heinen","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Antel","given":"Jack P."},{"family":"Hartung","given":"Hans-Peter"},{"family":"Küry","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"manousiIdentificationNovelMyelin2021","container-title":"EBioMedicine","container-title-short":"EBioMedicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103276","ISSN":"23523964","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3]]},"language":"en","page":"103276","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Identification of novel myelin repair drugs by modulation of oligodendroglial differentiation competence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352396421000694","volume":"65"},{"id":"manousiSmallMoleculeScreening2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Manousi","given":"Anastasia"},{"family":"Küry","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"manousiSmallMoleculeScreening2021","container-title":"Current Opinion in Pharmacology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Pharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.coph.2021.09.008","ISSN":"14714892","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"127-135","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Small molecule screening as an approach to encounter inefficient myelin repair","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471489221001533","volume":"61"},{"id":"manoutcharianRecombinantAntibodyFragments2024","abstract":":\n              Recombinant antibody fragments are promising alternatives to full-length immunoglobulins,\ncreating big opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 233 genetic variations associated with MS at the genome-wide significant level. Epigenetic studies have pinpointed differentially methylated CpG sites in MS patients. However, the interplay between genetic risk factors and epigenetic regulation remains elusive. Here, we employed a network model to integrate GWAS summary statistics of 14 802 MS cases and 26 703 controls with DNA methylation profiles from 140 MS cases and 139 controls and the human interactome. We identified differentially methylated genes by aggregating additive effects of differentially methylated CpG sites within promoter regions. We reconstructed a gene regulatory network (GRN) using literature-curated transcription factor knowledge. Colocalization of the MS GWAS and methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) was performed to assess the GRN. The resultant MS-associated GRN highlighted several single nucleotide polymorphisms with GWAS-mQTL colocalization: rs6032663, rs6065926 and rs2024568 of CD40 locus, rs9913597 of STAT3 locus, and rs887864 and rs741175 of CIITA locus. Moreover, synergistic mQTL and expression QTL signals were identified in CD40, suggesting gene expression alteration was likely induced by epigenetic changes. Web-based Cell-type Specific Enrichment Analysis of Genes (WebCSEA) indicated that the GRN was enriched in T follicular helper cells (P-value = 0.0016). Drug target enrichment analysis of annotations from the Therapeutic Target Database revealed the GRN was also enriched with drug target genes (P-value = 3.89 × 10−4), revealing repurposable candidates for MS treatment. These candidates included vorinostat (HDAC1 inhibitor) and sivelestat (ELANE inhibitor), which warrant further investigation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Manuel","given":"Astrid M"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Yulin"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Peilin"},{"family":"Freeman","given":"Leorah A"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Zhongming"}],"citation-key":"manuelGeneRegulatoryNetwork2023","container-title":"Human Molecular Genetics","DOI":"10.1093/hmg/ddac265","ISSN":"0964-6906, 1460-2083","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,6]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model","page":"998-1009","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A gene regulatory network approach harmonizes genetic and epigenetic signals and reveals repurposable drug candidates for multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/32/6/998/6772480","volume":"32"},{"id":"marangonOligodendrocyteProgenitorsGlial2024","abstract":"Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) represent a subtype of glia, giving rise to oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system (CNS).

In traumatic injuries and chronic neurodegenerative conditions, including those of autoimmune origin, oligodendrocytes undergo apoptosis, and demyelination starts. Adult OPCs become immediately activated; they migrate at the lesion site and proliferate to replenish the damaged area, but their efficiency is hampered by the presence of a glial scar—a barrier mainly formed by reactive astrocytes, microglia and the deposition of inhibitory extracellular matrix components. If, on the one hand, a glial scar limits the lesion spreading, it also blocks tissue regeneration. Therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing astrocyte or microglia activation and shifting them toward a neuroprotective phenotype have been proposed, whereas the role of OPCs has been largely overlooked. In this review, we have considered the glial scar from the perspective of OPCs, analysing their behaviour when lesions originate and exploring the potential therapies aimed at sustaining OPCs to efficiently differentiate and promote remyelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Marangon","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Castro E Silva","given":"Juliana Helena"},{"family":"Cerrato","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Boda","given":"Enrica"},{"family":"Lecca","given":"Davide"}],"citation-key":"marangonOligodendrocyteProgenitorsGlial2024","container-title":"Cells","container-title-short":"Cells","DOI":"10.3390/cells13121024","ISSN":"2073-4409","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,12]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1024","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Oligodendrocyte Progenitors in Glial Scar: A Bet on Remyelination","title-short":"Oligodendrocyte Progenitors in Glial Scar","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/13/12/1024","volume":"13"},{"id":"marastoniTwoYearsEffect2022","abstract":"Background:\n              Data on the effect of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) on focal and diffuse gray matter (GM) damage, a relevant pathological substrate of multiple sclerosis (MS)-related disability are lacking.\n            \n            \n              Objective:\n              To evaluate the DMF effect on cortical lesions (CLs) accumulation and global and regional GM atrophy in subjects with relapsing–remitting MS.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              A total of 148 patients (mean age 38.1 ± 9.7 years) treated with DMF ended a 2-year longitudinal study.

In Phase A, eligible patients received add-on THC:CBD spray for 4 weeks to identify initial responders [≥20% improvement from baseline in spasticity 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) score]. Following washout, eligible initial responders were randomised to receive THC:CBD spray or placebo for 12 weeks (double-blinded, Phase B). Optimisation of underlying antispasticity medications was permitted in both groups across all study periods. RESULTS: Of 191 patients who entered Phase A, 106 were randomised in Phase B to receive add-on THC:CBD spray (n = 53) or placebo (n = 53).

Notably, TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP43) accumulations are hallmark pathologies of FTD/ALS and mutations in the gene encoding TDP43 cause familial FTD/ALS. There are no cures for FTD/ALS. FTD/ALS display damage to a broad range of physiological functions, many of which are regulated by signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. This signaling is mediated by the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethering proteins that serve to recruit regions of ER to the mitochondrial surface so as to facilitate inter-organelle communications. Several studies have now shown that disrupted ER-mitochondria signaling including breaking of the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers are features of FTD/ALS and that for TDP43 and other familial genetic FTD/ALS insults, this involves activation of glycogen kinase-3β (GSK3β). Such findings have prompted suggestions that correcting damage to ER-mitochondria signaling and the VAPB-PTPIP51 interaction may be broadly therapeutic. Here we provide evidence to support this notion. We show that overexpression of VAPB or PTPIP51 to enhance ER-mitochondria signaling corrects mutant TDP43 induced damage to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor delivery of Ca\n              2+\n              to mitochondria which is a primary function of the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers, and to synaptic function. Moreover, we show that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), an FDA approved drug linked to FTD/ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases therapy and whose precise therapeutic target is unclear, corrects TDP43 linked damage to the VAPB-PTPIP51 interaction. We also show that this effect involves inhibition of TDP43 mediated activation of GSK3β. Thus, correcting damage to the VAPB-PTPIP51 tethers may have therapeutic value for FTD/ALS and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Markovinovic","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Martín-Guerrero","given":"Sandra M."},{"family":"Mórotz","given":"Gábor M."},{"family":"Salam","given":"Shaakir"},{"family":"Gomez-Suaga","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Paillusson","given":"Sebastien"},{"family":"Greig","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Younbok"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Jacqueline C."},{"family":"Noble","given":"Wendy"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Christopher C.J."}],"citation-key":"markovinovicStimulatingVAPBPTPIP51ERmitochondria2024","container-title":"Acta Neuropathologica Communications","container-title-short":"acta neuropathol commun","DOI":"10.1186/s40478-024-01742-x","ISSN":"2051-5960","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,23]]},"language":"en","page":"32","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Stimulating VAPB-PTPIP51 ER-mitochondria tethering corrects FTD/ALS mutant TDP43 linked Ca2+ and synaptic defects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-024-01742-x","volume":"12"},{"id":"marrodanTherapeuticPlasmaExchange2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Marrodan","given":"M."},{"family":"Crema","given":"S."},{"family":"Rubstein","given":"A."},{"family":"Alessandro","given":"L."},{"family":"Fernandez","given":"J."},{"family":"Correale","given":"J."},{"family":"Ysrraelit","given":"M.C."}],"citation-key":"marrodanTherapeuticPlasmaExchange2021","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2021.103168","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"language":"en","page":"103168","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Therapeutic plasma exchange in MS refractory relapses: Long-term outcome","title-short":"Therapeutic plasma exchange in MS refractory relapses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034821004351","volume":"55"},{"id":"martellRandomizedPlaceboControlledSingleBlind2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Martell","given":"Shelby G."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jeongwoon"},{"family":"Cannavale","given":"Corinne N."},{"family":"Mehta","given":"Twinkle D."},{"family":"Erdman","given":"John W."},{"family":"Adamson","given":"Brynn"},{"family":"Motl","given":"Robert W."},{"family":"Khan","given":"Naiman A."}],"citation-key":"martellRandomizedPlaceboControlledSingleBlind2023","container-title":"The Journal of Nutrition","container-title-short":"The Journal of Nutrition","DOI":"10.1016/j.tjnut.2023.06.027","ISSN":"00223166","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8]]},"language":"en","page":"2298-2311","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Single-Blind Study of Lutein Supplementation on Carotenoid Status and Cognition in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022316623724334","volume":"153"},{"id":"martin-riosExpandingPhenotypeSpectrum2025","abstract":"Purpose To expand the spectrum of clinical and biochemical phenotypes, and brain imaging features of individuals with β-mannosidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease.Methods We describe the clinical features of six patients with β-mannosidosis, their findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the changes over time in two of them. We also review previously reported patients, analyze the variants in MANBA, the first symptom and spectrum of symptoms, and the ages of onset and of diagnosis of the disease.Results Forty-four patients have been reported to date, including our patients. The mean age of diagnosis is 12.8 years, and the age of onset of symptoms is 2.4 years. Hearing loss is the most frequently reported initial symptom and intellectual disability is the most frequent symptom overall. Erythromelalgia, nystagmus, macrocephaly, and obsessive-compulsive-like behavior are newly described features associated with β-mannosidosis. 40% of the patients have abnormal brain imaging. Brain MRI showed hypomyelination in one patient and abnormal white matter changes in another patient. Twenty-nine pathogenic variants in MANBA have been reported among the 44 patients; 60.6% of patients have private variants, and 39.4% have the recurrent variant c.2158-2A&gt;G. A new oligosaccharide structure: Neu-Man2-GlcNac2, was found in the urine of two affected patients.Conclusion Due to disease heterogeneity, establishing a genotype-phenotype correlation remains challenging in β-mannosidosis.

The aim of this review was to investigate the efficacy and safety of nutraceutical interventions for clinical and biological outcomes in people with MS. METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA reporting guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted using three electronic literature databases. Risk of bias was assessed using the Jadad scale. RESULTS: Thirty-seven randomized controlled trials, investigating fourteen nutraceuticals, were included in the review. Trials that investigated alpha lipoic acid (n = 4/6), ginkgo biloba (n = 3/5), vitamin A (n = 2/2), biotin (n = 1/2), carnitine (n = 1/2), green tea (n = 1/2), coenzyme Q10 (n = 1/1), probiotics (n = 1/1), curcumin (n = 1/1), Andrographis paniculata (n = 1/1), ginseng (n = 1/1), and lemon verbena (n = 1/1) were reported to improve biological (e.g. MRI brain volume change, antioxidant capacity) and/or clinical (e.g. fatigue, depression, Expanded Disability Status Scale) outcomes in multiple sclerosis compared to control. However, most trials were relatively small (average study sample size across included studies, n = 55) and there were few replicate studies per nutraceutical to validate the reported results. Furthermore, some nutraceuticals (e.g. green tea and inosine) should be used with caution due to reported adverse events. Risk of bias across most studies was low, with 31 studies receiving a score between 4 and 5 (out of 5) on the Jadad Scale. CONCLUSION: The existing literature provides preliminary support for the use of a number of nutraceutical interventions in MS. However, sufficiently powered long-term trials are required to expand the currently limited literature and to investigate unexplored nutraceuticals that may target relevant pathways involved in MS such as the gut microbiome and mitochondrial dysfunction.

During the initial stages of the disease, injured myelin is replaced by mature myelinating oligodendrocytes that differentiate from oligodendrocyte precursor cells. However, myelin repair fails in secondary and chronic progressive stages of the disease and with ageing, as the environment becomes progressively more hostile. This may be attributable to inhibitory molecules in the multiple sclerosis environment including activation of the p38MAPK family of kinases. We explored oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and myelin repair using animals with conditional ablation of p38MAPKγ from oligodendrocyte precursors.\n            We found that p38γMAPK ablation accelerated oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and myelination. This resulted in an increase in both the total number of oligodendrocytes and the migration of progenitors ex vivo and faster remyelination in the cuprizone model of demyelination/remyelination. Consistent with its role as an inhibitor of myelination, p38γMAPK was significantly downregulated as oligodendrocyte precursor cells matured into oligodendrocytes. Notably, p38γMAPK was enriched in multiple sclerosis lesions from patients. Oligodendrocyte progenitors expressed high levels of p38γMAPK in areas of failed remyelination but did not express detectable levels of p38γMAPK in areas where remyelination was apparent.\n            Our data suggest that p38γ could be targeted to improve myelin repair in multiple sclerosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Marziali","given":"Leandro N"},{"family":"Hwang","given":"Yoonchan"},{"family":"Palmisano","given":"Marilena"},{"family":"Cuenda","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Sim","given":"Fraser J"},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Volsko","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Dutta","given":"Ranjan"},{"family":"Trapp","given":"Bruce D"},{"family":"Wrabetz","given":"Lawrence"},{"family":"Feltri","given":"Maria L"}],"citation-key":"marzialiP38gMAPKDelays2024","container-title":"Brain","DOI":"10.1093/brain/awad421","ISSN":"0006-8950, 1460-2156","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,3]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","page":"1871-1886","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"p38γ MAPK delays myelination and remyelination and is abundant in multiple sclerosis lesions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/147/5/1871/7490823","volume":"147"},{"id":"masudaRemyelinationNeuroprotectiveEffects2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Masuda","given":"Hiroki"},{"family":"Mori","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Kuwabara","given":"Satoshi"}],"citation-key":"masudaRemyelinationNeuroprotectiveEffects2021","container-title":"Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry","container-title-short":"J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1136/jnnp-2021-326821","ISSN":"0022-3050, 1468-330X","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1251-1251","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Remyelination and neuroprotective effects of alemtuzumab therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jnnp.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/jnnp-2021-326821","volume":"92"},{"id":"masvekarDrugLibraryScreen2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Masvekar","given":"Ruturaj"},{"family":"Kosa","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Barbour","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Milstein","given":"Joshua L"},{"family":"Bielekova","given":"Bibiana"}],"citation-key":"masvekarDrugLibraryScreen2022","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2022.103499","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2]]},"language":"en","page":"103499","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Drug library screen identifies inhibitors of toxic astrogliosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034822000141","volume":"58"},{"id":"mathieuOligodeoxynucleotideIMT504Effects2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mathieu","given":"Patricia A."},{"family":"Sampertegui","given":"Yim Rodriguez"},{"family":"Elias","given":"Fernanda"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Alexis Silva"},{"family":"De Luján Calcagno","given":"María"},{"family":"López","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Adamo","given":"Ana M."}],"citation-key":"mathieuOligodeoxynucleotideIMT504Effects2024","container-title":"Molecular Neurobiology","container-title-short":"Mol Neurobiol","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-023-03825-7","ISSN":"0893-7648, 1559-1182","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7]]},"language":"en","page":"4146-4165","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Oligodeoxynucleotide IMT504: Effects on Central Nervous System Repair Following Demyelination","title-short":"Oligodeoxynucleotide IMT504","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12035-023-03825-7","volume":"61"},{"id":"maTrehaloseEnhancesMacrophage2025","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Myelin-laden foamy macrophages accumulate extensively in the lesion epicenter, exhibiting characteristics of autophagolysosomal dysfunction, which leads to prolonged inflammatory responses after spinal cord injury (SCI).

Therefore, EVs represent a promising therapeutic strategy. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are myelinating glial cells developed from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and damaged in chronic demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Glycoprotein transferrin (Tf) plays a critical role in iron homeostasis and has pro‐differentiating effects on OLs in vivo and in vitro. In the current work, we evaluated the use of EVs as transporters of Tf to the central nervous system (CNS) through the intranasal (IN) route. For the in vitro mechanistic studies, we used rat plasma EVs. Our results show that EVTf enter OPCs through clathrin‐caveolae and cholesterol‐rich lipid raft endocytic pathways, releasing the cargo and exerting a pro‐maturation effect on OPCs. These effects were also observed in vivo using the animal model of demyelination induced by cuprizone (CPZ). In this model, IN administered Tf‐loaded EVs isolated from mouse plasma reached the brain parenchyma, internalizing into OPCs, promoting their differentiation, and accelerating remyelination. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrated that EVs protected the Tf cargo and significantly reduced the amount of Tf required to induce remyelination as compared to soluble Tf. Collectively, these findings unveil EVs as functional nanocarriers of Tf to induce remyelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mattera","given":"Vanesa"},{"family":"Occhiuzzi","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Correale","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Pasquini","given":"Juana M."}],"citation-key":"matteraRemyelinatingEffectDriven2024","container-title":"Glia","container-title-short":"Glia","DOI":"10.1002/glia.24478","ISSN":"0894-1491, 1098-1136","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2]]},"language":"en","page":"338-361","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Remyelinating effect driven by transferrin‐loaded extracellular vesicles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/glia.24478","volume":"72"},{"id":"maxSystematicReviewMetaanalysis2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Research on reflexology therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) is limited, and the evaluation is mixed.

Myelin assembles into a sheath and lines neuronal axons in the brain and spinal cord to insulate them. This not only increases the speed and efficiency of nerve signal transduction but also protects the axons from damage and degradation, which could trigger neuronal cell death. Demyelination, which is caused by a loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes, is a prominent feature of many neurological conditions, including Multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injuries (SCI), and leukodystrophies. Demyelination is followed by a time of remyelination mediated by the recruitment of endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells, their migration to the injury site, and differentiation into myelin‐producing oligodendrocytes. Unfortunately, endogenous remyelination is not sufficient to overcome demyelination, which explains why there are to date no regenerative‐based treatments for MS, SCI, or leukodystrophies. To better understand the role of oligodendrocytes and develop cell‐based remyelination therapies, human oligodendrocytes have been derived from somatic cells using cell reprogramming. This review will detail the different cell reprogramming methods that have been developed to generate human oligodendrocytes and their applications to disease modeling and cell‐based remyelination therapies. Recent developments in the field have seen the derivation of brain organoids from pluripotent stem cells, and protocols have been devised to incorporate oligodendrocytes within the organoids, which will also be reviewed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"McCaughey‐Chapman","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Connor","given":"Bronwen"}],"citation-key":"mccaughey-chapmanCellReprogrammingOligodendrocytes2023","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience Research","container-title-short":"J of Neuroscience Research","DOI":"10.1002/jnr.25173","ISSN":"0360-4012, 1097-4547","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6]]},"language":"en","page":"1000-1028","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cell reprogramming for oligodendrocytes: A review of protocols and their applications to disease modeling and cell‐based remyelination therapies","title-short":"Cell reprogramming for oligodendrocytes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.25173","volume":"101"},{"id":"mcclurgdAbdominalMassageAdvice2018","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Between 50% and 80% of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experience neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) (i.e. constipation and faecal incontinence) that affects quality of life and can lead to hospitalisation. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of abdominal massage plus advice on bowel symptoms on PwMS compared with advice only. A process evaluation investigated the factors that affected the clinical effectiveness and possible implementation of the different treatments. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial with process evaluation and health economic components. Outcome analysis was undertaken blind. SETTING: The trial took place in 12 UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: PwMS who had 'bothersome' NBD. INTERVENTION: Following individualised training, abdominal massage was undertaken daily for 6 weeks (intervention group). Advice on good bowel management as per the Multiple Sclerosis Society advice booklet was provided to both groups. All participants received weekly telephone calls from the research nurse. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the difference between the intervention and control groups in change in the NBD score from baseline to week 24. Secondary outcomes were measured via a bowel diary, adherence diary, the Constipation Scoring System, patient resource questionnaire and the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version (EQ-5D-5L).

The change in NBD score by week 24 demonstrated no significant difference between groups [mean difference total score -1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.32 to 0.04; p = 0.0558]; there was a significant difference between groups in the change in the frequency of stool evacuation per week (mean difference 0.62, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.21; p = 0.039) and in the number of times per week that participants felt that they emptied their bowels completely (mean difference 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.76; p = 0.002), in favour of the intervention group. Of participant interviewees, 75% reported benefits, for example less difficulty passing stool, more complete evacuations, less bloated, improved appetite, and 85% continued with the massage. A cost-utility analysis conducted from a NHS and patient cost perspective found in the imputed sample with bootstrapping a mean incremental outcome effect of the intervention relative to usual care of -0.002 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (95% CI -0.029 to 0.027 QALYs). In the same imputed sample with bootstrapping, the mean incremental cost effect of the intervention relative to usual care was £56.50 (95% CI -£372.62 to £415.68). No adverse events were reported. Limitations include unequal randomisation, dropout and the possibility of ineffective massage technique. CONCLUSION: The increment in the primary outcome favoured the intervention group, but it was small and not statistically significant. The economic analysis identified that the intervention was dominated by the control group. Given the small improvement in the primary outcome, but not in terms of QALYs, a low-cost version of the intervention might be considered worthwhile by some patients. FUTURE WORK: Research is required to establish possible mechanisms of action and modes of massage delivery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN85007023 and NCT03166007.

We have performed a meta-analysis with the aim of investigating the role of therapeutic vitamin D in MS. Methods: A systematic search of databases was performed to identify clinical trials assessing vitamin D in patients with relapsing–remitting MS. Studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Results: Twelve studies involving 950 patients were included in the final analysis. Studies were divided into four groups because of heterogeneity in study design. Studies were judged to be at low or unclear risk of bias, except in three studies, and this was confirmed by funnel plots. No statistically significant difference was seen for any of the outcome measures. There were non-significant trends in favour of vitamin D for all outcome measures, particularly when only placebo-controlled studies were included. Dose comparison studies showed a significant increase in annualised relapse rate (mean difference 0.15 [95%CI 0.01–0.30]) and non-significant trends of increased Expanded Disability Status Scale and gadolinium-enhancing lesions for the higher-dose arms. Conclusion: These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation may have a therapeutic role in the treatment of MS. However, there is uncertainty with regard to the most appropriate dose, with high doses potentially being associated with worse outcomes. There remains the need for further well-performed randomised, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D in MS.","author":[{"literal":"McLaughlin L"},{"literal":"Clarke L"},{"literal":"Khalilidehkordi E"},{"literal":"Butzkueven H"},{"literal":"Taylor B"},{"literal":"Broadley S A"}],"citation-key":"mclaughlinlVitaminTreatmentMultiple2018","container-title":"Journal of Neurology","DOI":"10.1007/s00415-018-9074-6","ISSN":"1432-1459 0340-5354","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"2893-2905","title":"Vitamin D for the treatment of multiple sclerosis: a meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-018-9074-6","volume":"265"},{"id":"mcnamaraMicrogliaRegulateCentral2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Myelin is required for the function of neuronal axons in the central nervous system, but the mechanisms that support myelin health are unclear.

We show that loss of myelin health due to the absence of microglia is associated with the appearance of a myelinating oligodendrocyte state with altered lipid metabolism. Moreover, this mechanism is regulated through disruption of the TGFβ1–TGFβR1 axis.

Taurine and homotaurine (HT) are naturally occurring sulfonate amino acids, with taurine being highly abundant in animal tissues, but declining with age in the blood. HT is a blood-brain barrier permeable drug under investigation for Alzheimer’s disease. HT also has beneficial effects in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis likely through an anti-inflammatory mechanism mediated by GABA\n              A\n              receptor (GABA\n              A\n              R) agonism in immune cells. While both taurine and HT are structural GABA analogs and thought to be GABA mimetics at GABA\n              A\n              Rs, there is uncertainty concerning their potency as GABA mimetics on native GABA\n              A\n              Rs. We show that HT is a very potent GABA mimetic, as it evokes GABA\n              A\n              R-mediated currents with an EC\n              50\n              of 0.4 μM (vs. 3.7 μM for GABA and 116 µM for taurine) in murine cerebellar granule cells in brain slices, with both taurine and HT having similar efficacy in activating native GABA\n              A\n              Rs.

In the present study, the impact of STAT3 inhibition on cognition, cerebrovascular function, amyloid pathology, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation was studied using in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related pathology. For in vitro experiments, human brain vascular smooth muscle cells (HBVSMC) and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were used, and these cultured cells were exposed to Aβ peptides followed by measurement of activated forms of STAT3 expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Further, 6 months old 5XFAD/APOE4 (5XE4) mice and age-matched negative littermates were used for in vivo experiments. These mice were treated with STAT3 specific inhibitor, LLL-12 for 2 months followed by neurobehavioral and histopathological assessment. In vitro experiments showed exposure of cerebrovascular cells to Aβ peptides upregulated activated forms of STAT3 and produced STAT3-mediated vascular oxidative stress. 5XE4 mice treated with the STAT3-specific inhibitor (LLL-12) improved cognitive functions and functional connectivity and augmented cerebral blood flow. These functional improvements were associated with a reduction in neuritic plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Reduction in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and attenuation of oxidative modification of lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP-1) were identified as potential underlying mechanisms.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, originally developed for diabetes management, are increasingly studied for their cognitive benefits. These benefits may include reduction of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, decrease of amyloid burdens, enhancement of neuronal plasticity, and improved cerebral glucose utilization. The multifaceted effects and the relatively favorable side-effect profile of SGLT2 inhibitors render them a promising therapeutic candidate for cognitive disorders. Nonetheless, the application of SGLT2 inhibitors for cognitive impairment is not without its limitations, necessitating more comprehensive research to fully determine their therapeutic potential for cognitive treatment. In this review, we discuss the role of SGLT2 in neural function, elucidate the diabetes-cognition nexus, and synthesize current knowledge on the cognitive effects of SGLT2 inhibitors based on animal studies and clinical evidence. Research gaps are proposed to spur further investigation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mei","given":"Jiaqi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Liyan"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Ruikai"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Mingyue"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jingdong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Deju"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Xiaoping"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Yunfeng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jianping"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Minxuan"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Panpan"},{"family":"Ling","given":"Jitao"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yuting"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jianqi"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Peng"}],"citation-key":"meiSGLT2InhibitorsNovel2024","container-title":"Translational Neurodegeneration","container-title-short":"Transl Neurodegener","DOI":"10.1186/s40035-024-00431-y","ISSN":"2047-9158","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,9]]},"language":"en","page":"41","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"SGLT2 inhibitors: a novel therapy for cognitive impairment via multifaceted effects on the nervous system","title-short":"SGLT2 inhibitors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://translationalneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40035-024-00431-y","volume":"13"},{"id":"melnikovSerotonergicDrugRepurposing2022","abstract":"Investigation of neuroimmune interactions is one of the most developing areas in the study of multiple sclerosis pathogenesis.

In this paper we discuss some conceptual foundation for a clinical implementation of a machine learning system and argue that both vendors and users should take certain responsibilities, as is already common practice for high-risk medical equipment. We propose the methodology from AAPM Task Group 100 report No. 283 as a conceptual framework for developing risk-driven a quality management program for a clinical process that encompasses a machine learning system. This is illustrated with an example of a clinical workflow. Our analysis shows how the risk evaluation in this framework can accommodate artificial intelligence based systems independently of their robustness evaluation or the user's in-house expertise. In particular, we highlight how the degree of interpretability of a machine learning system can be systematically accounted for within the risk evaluation and in the development of a quality management system.","author":[{"family":"Mercolli","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Rominger","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Kuangyu"}],"citation-key":"mercolliQualityManagementArtificial2024","container-title":"Zeitschrift Fur Medizinische Physik","container-title-short":"Z Med Phys","DOI":"10.1016/j.zemedi.2024.02.001","ISSN":"1876-4436","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,26]]},"language":"eng","page":"S0939-3889(24)00024-2","PMID":"38413355","source":"PubMed","title":"Towards quality management of artificial intelligence systems for medical applications","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"metzChatbotsMayHallucinate2023","abstract":"When summarizing facts, ChatGPT technology makes things up about 3 percent of the time, according to research from a new start-up.

Particularly, PTEN inhibition is a key driver of successful CNS axon regeneration after optic nerve or spinal cord injury. In contrast, in peripheral neurons, TSG influence in neuronal morphology, physiology, and pathology has not been investigated to the same depth. In this study, we conditionally deleted PTEN from mouse facial motoneurons (\n              \n                Chat-Cre/Pten\n                loxP/loxP\n              \n              ) and analyzed neuronal responses\n              in vivo\n              with or without peripheral facial nerve injury in male and female mice. In uninjured motoneurons, PTEN loss induced somatic, axonal, and nerve hypertrophy, synaptic terminal enlargement and reduction in physiological whisker movement. Despite these morphologic and physiological changes, PTEN deletion positively regulated facial nerve regeneration and recovery of whisker movement after nerve injury. Regenerating PTEN-deficient motoneurons upregulated P-CREB and a signaling pathway involving P-Akt, P-PRAS40, P-mTOR, and P-4EBP1. In aged mice (12 months), PTEN deletion induced hair loss and facial hyperplasia of the epidermis. This suggests a time window in younger mice with PTEN loss stimulating axon growth after injury, however, at the risk of hyperplasia formation at later time points in the old animal. Overall, our data highlight a dual TSG function with PTEN loss impairing physiological neuron function but furthermore underscoring the positive effects of PTEN ablation in axon regeneration also for the PNS.\n            \n            \n              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT\n              Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) restrict cell proliferation and growth. TSG inhibition, including p53 and PTEN, stimulates axon regeneration after CNS injury. In contrast, in PNS axon regeneration, TSGs have not been analyzed in great depth. Herein we show enhanced peripheral axon regeneration after PTEN deletion from facial motoneurons. This invokes a signaling cascade with novel PTEN partners, including CREB and PRAS40. In adult mice, PTEN loss induces hyperplasia of the skin epidermis, suggesting detrimental consequences when reaching adulthood in contrast to a beneficial TSG role for regeneration in young adult mice. Thus, our data highlight the double-edged sword nature of interfering with TSG function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer Zu Reckendorf","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Moser","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Blechschmidt","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Joga","given":"Venkata Neeha"},{"family":"Sinske","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Hegler","given":"Jutta"},{"family":"Deininger","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Catanese","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Vettorazzi","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Antoniadis","given":"Gregor"},{"family":"Boeckers","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Knöll","given":"Bernd"}],"citation-key":"meyerzureckendorfMotoneuronSpecificPTENDeletion2022","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

However, penetrance is incomplete, and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown.Methods and Results Transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood was conducted with 9 MMD patients and 5 unaffected mutation carriers from 4 familial MMD pedigrees. Bayesian network analysis identified upregulated gene modules associated with lipid metabolism and leukocyte development (including GATA2 and SLC45A3), and EGFR signaling (UBTD1). It also identified downregulated gene modules related to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (RPS3A and RPL26), and cytotoxic T cell immunity (GZMA and TRGC1). The GATA2 network was replicated through WGCNA analysis and further examined in a case-control study, comprising 43 MMD patients, 16 non-MMD patients, 19 unaffected carriers, and 35 healthy controls. GATA2 exhibited a significant linear correlation with SLC45A3 and was significantly higher in MMD patients compared to age- and sex-matched unaffected carriers or wild-type controls. Among patients with the p.R4810K mutation, higher GATA2 expression was associated with an earlier age of onset, bilateral involvement, and symptomatic disease onset.Conclusions Peripheral blood GATA2 expression was associated with increased penetrance of the RNF213 mutation and more severe clinical manifestations in MMD.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (KAKENHI 17H06397, 19H03770) and from Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (JP21bm0804032h0001, JP22bm0804032h0002, JP23bm0804032h0003).

Viruses can directly invade the brain and infect neuronal cells or indirectly trigger a “cytokine storm” in the periphery that eventually leads to microglial activation in the brain. While this initial activation of microglial cells is important for viral clearance, chronic activation leads to excessive inflammation and oxidative stress, which can be neurotoxic. Remarkebly, recent studies have shown that certain viruses such as influenza A virus, coronavirus, herpes virus and Epstein–Barr virus may be involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. Therefore, it is important to find therapeutic strategies against chronic neuroinflammation triggered by viral infections. Here, we investigated the effects of urolithin A (UA) on microglial activation\n              in vitro\n              induced by a viral mimetic, poly I:C, in a triple co-culture system of neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells. Immunocytochemistry was used to perform a comprehensive single-cell analysis of the morphological changes of microglia as an indicator of their reactive state. Treatment with UA significantly prevented the poly I:C-induced reactive state of microglia, which was characterized by increased expression of the microglial activation markers CD68 and IBA-1. UA restored the poly I:C-induced morphology by restoring microglial ramification. In addition, UA was able to reduce the release of the pro-inflammatory mediators CCL2, TNF-α, and IL-1β and showed a trend toward attenuation of cellular ROS production in poly I:C-treated cultures. Overall, this study suggests that UA as a component of a healthy diet may help prevent virus-induced neuroinflammation and may have therapeutic potential for future studies to prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases by targeting the associated neuroinflammatory processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mingo","given":"Yakum Benard"},{"family":"Gabele","given":"Lea"},{"family":"Lonnemann","given":"Niklas"},{"family":"Brône","given":"Bert"},{"family":"Korte","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Hosseini","given":"Shirin"}],"citation-key":"mingoEffectsUrolithinPoly2024","container-title":"Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

The pooled effect size showed that Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (WMD = -0.43; 95% CI = -0.65, -0.20; P < .001), Beck Depression Inventory-Ⅱ (BDI-Ⅱ) (WMD = -3.22; 95% CI = -4.38, -2.06; P < .001) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) (WMD = -4.37; 95% CI = -6.43, -2.31; P < .001) were improved following probiotics supplementation. However, body weight and body mass index did not statistically change. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that probiotics supplementation can improve disease progression, suppress depression, and general health in MS patients; although, further investigations may be needed.","author":[{"literal":"Mirashrafi S"},{"literal":"Hejazi Taghanaki"},{"literal":"S Z"},{"literal":"Sarlak F"},{"literal":"Moravejolahkami A R"},{"literal":"Hojjati Kermani"},{"literal":"M A"},{"literal":"Haratian M"}],"citation-key":"mirashrafisEffectProbioticsSupplementation2021","container-title":"Int J Clin Pract","DOI":"10.1111/ijcp.14724","ISSN":"1368-5031","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"e14724","title":"Effect of probiotics supplementation on disease progression, depression, general health, and anthropometric measurements in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14724","volume":"75"},{"id":"mirmotahariHybridDerivativesContaining2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mirmotahari","given":"Seyedeh Azin"},{"family":"Aliomrani","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Hassanzadeh","given":"Farshid"},{"family":"Sirous","given":"Hajar"},{"family":"Rostami","given":"Mahboubeh"}],"citation-key":"mirmotahariHybridDerivativesContaining2024","container-title":"DARU Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences","container-title-short":"DARU J Pharm Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s40199-024-00529-8","ISSN":"2008-2231","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,6]]},"language":"en","page":"599-615","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hybrid derivatives containing dimethyl fumarate and benzothiazole scaffolds for the potential treatment of multiple sclerosis; in silico & in vivo study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40199-024-00529-8","volume":"32"},{"id":"mirowska-guzelHerpesZosterPrevention2025","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mirowska-Guzel","given":"Dagmara"},{"family":"Nojszewska","given":"Monika"},{"family":"Jaroszewicz","given":"Jerzy"},{"family":"Kalinowska","given":"Alicja"},{"family":"Kułakowska","given":"Alina"},{"family":"Ledwoch","given":"Justyna"},{"family":"Małecka","given":"Ilona"},{"family":"Nitsch-Osuch","given":"Aneta"},{"family":"Rejdak","given":"Konrad"},{"family":"Stasiołek","given":"Mariusz"},{"family":"Bartosik-Psujek","given":"Halina"},{"family":"Brola","given":"Waldemar"},{"family":"Mastalerz-Migas","given":"Agnieszka"},{"family":"Wawrzyniak","given":"Sławomir"},{"family":"Wysocki","given":"Jacek"},{"family":"Zakrzewska-Pniewska","given":"Beata"},{"family":"Adamczyk-Sowa","given":"Monika"}],"citation-key":"mirowska-guzelHerpesZosterPrevention2025","container-title":"Neurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska","container-title-short":"Neurol Neurochir Pol.","DOI":"10.5603/pjnns.102908","ISSN":"1897-4260, 0028-3843","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"page":"VM/OJS/J/102908","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Herpes zoster prevention in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.viamedica.pl/neurologia_neurochirurgia_polska/article/view/102908"},{"id":"mirzadehGSMSymbolicUnderstandingLimitations2024","abstract":"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their formal reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. The GSM8K benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has significantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we conduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed for the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mirzadeh","given":"Iman"},{"family":"Alizadeh","given":"Keivan"},{"family":"Shahrokhi","given":"Hooman"},{"family":"Tuzel","given":"Oncel"},{"family":"Bengio","given":"Samy"},{"family":"Farajtabar","given":"Mehrdad"}],"citation-key":"mirzadehGSMSymbolicUnderstandingLimitations2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,7]]},"number":"arXiv:2410.05229","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models","title-short":"GSM-Symbolic","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05229"},{"id":"mirzaeiFingolimodEffectsBrain2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            Fingolimod (FTY720) is an oral drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for management of multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms, which has also shown beneficial effects against Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases pathologies. Although an extensive effort has been made to identify mechanisms underpinning its therapeutic effects, much remains unknown. Here, we investigated Fingolimod induced proteome changes in the cerebellum (CB) and frontal cortex (FC) regions of the brain which are known to be severely affected in MS, using a tandem mass tag (TMT) isobaric labeling‐based quantitative mass‐spectrometric approach to investigate the mechanism of action of Fingolimod. This study identified 6749 and 6319 proteins in CB and FC, respectively, and returned 2609 and 3086 differentially expressed proteins in mouse CB and FC, respectively, between Fingolimod treated and control groups. Subsequent bioinformatics analyses indicated a metabolic reprogramming in both brain regions of the Fingolimod treated group, where oxidative phosphorylation was upregulated while glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway were downregulated. In addition, modulation of neuroinflammation in the Fingolimod treated group was indicated by upregulation of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling and autophagy pathways, and downregulation of neuroinflammation related pathways including neutrophil degranulation and the IL‐12 mediated signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that Fingolimod may exert its protective effects on the brain by inducing metabolic reprogramming and neuroinflammation pathway modulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mirzaei","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Abyadeh","given":"Morteza"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Anita J."},{"family":"Wall","given":"Roshana Vander"},{"family":"Chick","given":"Joel M."},{"family":"Paulo","given":"Joao A."},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Veer K."},{"family":"Basavarajappa","given":"Devaraj"},{"family":"Chitranshi","given":"Nitin"},{"family":"Mirshahvaladi","given":"Seyed Shahab Oddin"},{"family":"You","given":"Yuyi"},{"family":"Fitzhenry","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Amirkhani","given":"Ardeshir"},{"family":"Haynes","given":"Paul A."},{"family":"Klistorner","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Vivek"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Stuart L."}],"citation-key":"mirzaeiFingolimodEffectsBrain2022","container-title":"PROTEOMICS","container-title-short":"Proteomics","DOI":"10.1002/pmic.202100247","ISSN":"1615-9853, 1615-9861","issue":"19-20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10]]},"language":"en","page":"2100247","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fingolimod effects on the brain are mediated through biochemical modulation of bioenergetics, autophagy, and neuroinflammatory networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.202100247","volume":"22"},{"id":"miserendinoSWELancerCanFrontier2025","abstract":"We introduce SWE-Lancer, a benchmark of over 1,400 freelance software engineering tasks from Upwork, valued at \\$1 million USD total in real-world payouts.

Macrophages and microglia adopt different properties depending on their microenvironment, and exposure to IL4 and IL13 has been used to elicit repair. Unexpectedly, while LPS-exposed macrophages and microglia killed neural cells in culture, the addition of LPS to IL4/IL13-treated macrophages and microglia profoundly elevated IL10, repair metabolites, heparin binding epidermal growth factor trophic factor, antioxidants, and matrix-remodeling proteases. In C57BL/6 female mice, the generation of M(LPS/IL4/IL13) macrophages required TLR4 and MyD88 signaling, downstream activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/mTOR and MAP kinases, and convergence on phospho-CREB, STAT6, and NFE2. Following mouse spinal cord demyelination, local LPS/IL4/IL13 deposition markedly increased lesional phagocytic macrophages/microglia, lactate and heparin binding epidermal growth factor, matrix remodeling, oligodendrogenesis, and remyelination. Our data show that a prominent reparative state of macrophages/microglia is generated by the unexpected integration of pro- and anti-inflammatory activation cues. The results have translational potential, as the LPS/IL4/IL13 mixture could be locally applied to a focal CNS injury to enhance neural regeneration and recovery.\n            \n              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT\n              The combination of LPS and regulatory IL4 and IL13 signaling in macrophages and microglia produces a previously unknown and particularly reparative phenotype devoid of pro-inflammatory neurotoxic features.

CNS problems are a primary concern because of the complexity of the brain. There are various drugs available to treat CNS disorders and overcome problems with toxicity, specificity, and delivery. Barriers like the blood–brain barrier (BBB) are a challenge, as they do not allow therapeutic drugs to cross and reach their target. Researchers have been searching for ways to allow drugs to pass through the BBB and reach the target sites. These problems highlight the need of nanotechnology to alter or manipulate various processes at the cellular level to achieve the desired attributes. Due to their nanosize, nanoparticles are able to pass through the BBB and are an effective alternative to drug administration and other approaches. Nanotechnology has the potential to improve treatment and diagnostic techniques for CNS disorders and facilitate effective drug transfer. With the aid of nanoengineering, drugs could be modified to perform functions like transference across the BBB, altering signaling pathways, targeting specific cells, effective gene transfer, and promoting regeneration and preservation of nerve cells.

Current reports have signified that the pleiotropic effects of MSCs are not related to their differentiation potentials, but rather are exerted through the release of soluble paracrine molecules. Being nano-sized, non-toxic, biocompatible, barely immunogenic, and owning targeting capability and organotropism, exosomes are considered nanocarriers for their possible use in diagnosis and therapy. Exosomes convey functional molecules such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and micro-RNAs (miRNAs), proteins (e.g., chemokine and cytokine), and lipids from MSCs to the target cells. They participate in intercellular interaction procedures and enable the repair of damaged or diseased tissues and organs. Findings have evidenced that exosomes alone are liable for the beneficial influences of MSCs in a myriad of experimental models, suggesting that MSC- exosomes can be utilized to establish a novel cell-free therapeutic strategy for the treatment of varied human disorders, encompassing myocardial infarction (MI), CNS-related disorders, musculoskeletal disorders (e.g. arthritis), kidney diseases, liver diseases, lung diseases, as well as cutaneous wounds. Importantly, compared with MSCs, MSC- exosomes serve more steady entities and reduced safety risks concerning the injection of live cells, such as microvasculature occlusion risk. In the current review, we will discuss the therapeutic potential of MSC- exosomes as an innovative approach in the context of regenerative medicine and highlight the recent knowledge on MSC- exosomes

One notable challenge in MSCs therapy is the bench to bed timeline of freshly cultured MSCs; it does not exceed 24 h. For use after 24 h, MSC need to be cryopreserved - which can preserve the cells for years - but it is a costly and damaging process. Here we introduce a method to extend the bench to bed lifetime of MSCs up to 4 days without the high cost and cell damaging effects of cryopreservation. Our method is based on preserving the MSCs in human plasma.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              MSCs of 12 tissue samples - 4 adipose, 4 bone marrow and 4 Wharton’s jelly- were cultured and expanded in standard conditions. Cells harvested from passage 2 or 3 were washed, centrifuged, pelleted, and re-suspended in human plasma. Cell suspensions were refrigerated (5 ± 3 °C) or stored at room temperature (22 ± 3 °C) in a sterile, temperature controlled room. During the next 7 days, two tubes (one from each group) were examined every 24 h to assess MSCs viability and growth potential. On day 3, we assessed MSC cell surface markers and its differentiation potential to adipocyte and osteocyte tissues. Results were analyzed by computing the overall mean and applying the independent-samples t-test to those means.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The sample means for both cell expansion and cell viability were compared between the two “refrigerator” and “room temperature” groups. Although there was a gradual decrease in cell growth potential between the cells stored for 1 day to those stored for 7 days, we show more than 80% of the cells remain alive for up to 4 days of storage in both groups. The cells reached 80% confluency in under 20 days for all samples stored up to 4 days. No significant differences were observed between the two groups (room temperature and refrigerator stored). The differentiation potential to adipocyte and osteocyte tested on day 3 were positive in all samples. The analysis of cell surface markers tested on day 3 were positive for CD90, CD105, CD73 and negative for CD34, CD45 and HLA-DR.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              We present a method of MSC culture medium using human plasma that can preserve their viability and growth potential for up to 4 days in both room and refrigerator temperatures without losing their stemness characteristics (we recommend use of 5 ± 3 °C). This novel method will allow rapid expansion and therapeutic use of MSCs. Since the cells can be maintained in clinical grade, injection ready state for several days, they can be transported across the globe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mohyeddin Bonab","given":"Mandana"},{"family":"Talebian","given":"Fatemeh"},{"family":"Borzabadi","given":"Aida"},{"family":"Nasr","given":"Vahideh"},{"family":"Abedi Kooshlshahi","given":"Azam"},{"family":"Anisie","given":"Fahime"},{"family":"Haghshenas","given":"Ronaz"},{"family":"Shalbafan","given":"Bita"},{"family":"Janzamin","given":"Ehsan"},{"family":"Shahbeigi","given":"Saeed"}],"citation-key":"mohyeddinbonabNovelMethodMaintaining2021","container-title":"Translational Medicine Communications","container-title-short":"transl med commun","DOI":"10.1186/s41231-021-00103-3","ISSN":"2396-832X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"24","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A novel method for maintaining the stability of freshly cultured Mesenchymal stem cells in clinical grade injection ready state without cryopreservation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://transmedcomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41231-021-00103-3","volume":"6"},{"id":"mojaverrostamiCombinationEffectsMesenchymal2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mojaverrostami","given":"Sina"},{"family":"Khadivi","given":"Farnaz"},{"family":"Zarini","given":"Davood"},{"family":"Mohammadi","given":"Alireza"}],"citation-key":"mojaverrostamiCombinationEffectsMesenchymal2022","container-title":"Journal of Molecular Histology","container-title-short":"J Mol Histol","DOI":"10.1007/s10735-022-10092-8","ISSN":"1567-2379, 1567-2387","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10]]},"language":"en","page":"817-831","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Combination effects of mesenchymal stem cells transplantation and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation on a cuprizone-induced mouse model of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10735-022-10092-8","volume":"53"},{"id":"mokhtarzadehkhanghahiNeuroglialComponentsBrain2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mokhtarzadeh Khanghahi","given":"Akram"},{"family":"Rayatpour","given":"Atefeh"},{"family":"Baharvand","given":"Hossein"},{"family":"Javan","given":"Mohammad"}],"citation-key":"mokhtarzadehkhanghahiNeuroglialComponentsBrain2023","container-title":"Neurological Sciences","container-title-short":"Neurol Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s10072-023-06915-5","ISSN":"1590-1874, 1590-3478","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"language":"en","page":"3795-3807","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neuroglial components of brain lesions may provide new therapeutic strategies for multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10072-023-06915-5","volume":"44"},{"id":"mondalAmeliorationExperimentalAutoimmune2024","abstract":"It is important to describe effective and non-toxic therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune demyelinating disease. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease that serves as a model for MS. Earlier we and others have shown that, gemfibrozil, a lipid-lowering drug, exhibits therapeutic efficacy in EAE. However, the underlying mechanism was poorly understood. Although gemfibrozil is a known ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), here, we established that oral administration of gemfibrozil preserved the integrity of blood–brain barrier (BBB) and blood–spinal cord barrier (BSB), decreased the infiltration of mononuclear cells into the CNS and inhibited the disease process of EAE in both wild type and PPARα\n              –/–\n              mice. On the other hand, oral gemfibrozil was found ineffective in maintaining the integrity of BBB/BSB, suppressing inflammatory infiltration and reducing the disease process of EAE in mice lacking PPARβ (formerly PPARδ), indicating an important role of PPARβ/δ, but not PPARα, in gemfibrozil-mediated preservation of BBB/BSB and protection of EAE. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in the disease process of EAE/MS and we also demonstrated that oral gemfibrozil protected Tregs in WT and PPARα\n              –/–\n              EAE mice, but not PPARβ\n              –/–\n              EAE mice.

The development of interventions that potentiate remyelination could hold promise as a novel treatment strategy for MS. To this end, our group has demonstrated that neural precursor cells (NPCs) residing in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of the adult mouse brain contribute significantly to remyelination in response to central nervous system (CNS) demyelination and can regenerate myelin of normal thickness. However, aging takes its toll on the regenerative potential of NPCs and reduces their contribution to remyelination. In this study, we investigated how aging influences the contribution of NPCs to oligodendrogenesis during the remyelination process and whether the delivery of growth factors into the brains of aged mice could potentiate the oligodendrogenic potential of NPCs. To enable us to map the fate of NPCs in response to demyelination induced at different postnatal ages,\n            \n              Nestin-CreER\n              T2\n            \n            ;\n            Rosa26-LSL-eYFP\n            mice were gavaged with tamoxifen at either 8 weeks, 30 weeks or one year of age before being challenged with cuprizone for a period of six weeks. Using osmotic minipumps, we infused heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and/or epidermal growth factor (EGF) into the cisterna magna for a period of two weeks beginning at the peak of cuprizone-induced demyelination (n=6-8 mice per group). Control mice received artificial cerebrospinal fluid (vehicle) alone. Mice were perfused six weeks after cuprizone withdrawal and the contribution of NPCs to oligodendrocyte regeneration in the corpus callosum was assessed. Our data reveal that although NPC-derived oligodendrocyte generation declined dramatically with age, this decline was partially reversed by growth factor infusion. Notably, co-infusion of EGF and HB-EGF increased oligodendrocyte regeneration twofold in some regions of the corpus callosum. Our results shed light on the beneficial effects of EGF and HB-EGF for increasing the contribution of NPCs to remyelination and indicate their therapeutic potential to combat the negative effects of aging upon remyelination efficacy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Moradi","given":"Kaveh"},{"family":"Mitew","given":"Stanislaw"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Yao Lulu"},{"family":"Merson","given":"Tobias D."}],"citation-key":"moradiHBEGFEGFInfusion2024","DOI":"10.1101/2024.02.26.582092","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,28]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Neuroscience","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"HB-EGF and EGF infusion following CNS demyelination mitigates age-related decline in regeneration of oligodendrocytes from neural precursor cells originating in the ventricular-subventricular zone","type":"article","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2024.02.26.582092"},{"id":"moradiPreventiveEffectZingiber2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Moradi","given":"Valiollah"},{"family":"Ghanadian","given":"Seyed Mostafa"},{"family":"Rashidi","given":"Bahman"},{"family":"Ghasemi","given":"Nazem"},{"family":"Dashti","given":"Gholamreza"},{"family":"Esfandiari","given":"Ebrahim"}],"citation-key":"moradiPreventiveEffectZingiber2023","container-title":"Avicenna Journal of Phytomedicine","container-title-short":"Avicenna Journal of Phytomedicine","DOI":"10.22038/ajp.2023.22784","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"language":"eng","source":"DOI.org (CSL JSON)","title":"The preventive effect of Zingiber officinale essential oil on demyelination of corpus callosum in a cuprizone rat model of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.22038/ajp.2023.22784","volume":"13"},{"id":"moravejolahkamiAntiinflammatoryantioxidantModificationsSynbiotics2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Moravejolahkami","given":"Amir Reza"},{"family":"Chitsaz","given":"Ahmad"},{"family":"Hassanzadeh","given":"Akbar"},{"family":"Paknahad","given":"Zamzam"}],"citation-key":"moravejolahkamiAntiinflammatoryantioxidantModificationsSynbiotics2023","container-title":"Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice","container-title-short":"Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice","DOI":"10.1016/j.ctcp.2023.101794","ISSN":"17443881","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"language":"en","page":"101794","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Anti-inflammatory-antioxidant modifications and synbiotics improved health-related conditions in patients with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis: A single-center, randomized clinical trial","title-short":"Anti-inflammatory-antioxidant modifications and synbiotics improved health-related conditions in patients with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1744388123000750","volume":"53"},{"id":"morenoWhoShallSurvive1934","abstract":"In approaching the contents of this book, the reader must not expect to find society or social groups considered as if they consisted of the sum of the individuals composing them.

To develop and test new management strategies, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying HD progression is needed. Aberrant changes in thalamo-cortical and striato-cerebellar circuitry have been observed in asymptomatic HD, along with transient enlargement of the dentate nucleus.Purpose To evaluate the relationship between thalamo-cerebellar connectivity and HD progression.Study Type Prospective and retrospective.Population Patients with HD and healthy controls from a single-center dataset (n=34), and patients from the public TRACK-HD dataset (n=91).Field strength/Sequence 3T and 7T.Assessment Thalamo-cerebellar connectivity was compared across patients and controls and related to motor scores and predicted years to symptom onset. Cross-sectional findings were validated within-patient by mapping changes in individual connectivity over time. HD effects on cognitive performance were also explored and related to connectivity.Statistical Tests Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Dunn’s tests and Pearson correlations (psignificant&lt;0.05).Results In the 7T cohort, significant premanifest and control group differences in thalamo-dentate connectivity were observed (pDunn&lt;0.05, η2=.19-.22), with manifest HD connectivity approaching normative values. Thalamic connectivity with the dentate nucleus and anterior cerebellum also correlated with years to onset (pDen=0.06, r=0.42, pAnt&lt;0.05, r=-0.45), together indicating potential transient functional alterations in premanifest HD. Similar patterns were observed between connectivity (thalamus to dentate nucleus and anterior lobe) and cognitive performance scores across all subjects (p&lt;0.05, rDen=-0.17, rAnt=-0.18). In the premanifest TRACK-HD cohort, connectivity of multiple thalamo-cerebellar connections correlated with years to onset, revealing distinct patterns for patients with low versus high motor scores, again indicative of potential transient alterations. Exploratory non-parametric regression of serial imaging data further supported these findings.Data conclusion Transient changes in thalamo-cerebellar connectivity are seen in premanifest HD with increasing progression.

This research desires to evaluate the tolerability and beneficial effects of exogenous melatonin supplementations in patients with MS. METHODS: This study was executed following the PRISMA 2020 statement. Both observational and interventional studies which reported the clinical effectiveness and/or safety of melatonin supplementation in patients with MS were included in this systematic review. Ovid, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched and the risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools based on study design. RESULTS: Out of 1304 results of database searches, finally, 14 articles, including 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 6 case-control studies, and one quasi-experimental study, were included based on the full-text review. Included phenotypes of MS were mostly relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (in 11 studies); it was secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in only one study, and two other studies had a mixture of the different phenotypes. The course of treatment with melatonin supplementation was between 2 weeks and 12 months. There were no substantial safety issues. Although melatonin was associated with enhanced oxidative stress and inflammation status, concerning the clinical benefits, limited studies suggested improvements in sleep conditions, cognitive outcomes, and fatigue in MS. DISCUSSION: There are insufficient data to support the regular melatonin prescription in MS. Limitations such as the small number of included studies, the diversity of the dosage, route, and duration of melatonin administration, and the diversity of assessment tests lead to unconvincing findings in this study. There is a need for future studies to achieve a comprehensive judgment on this subject.","author":[{"literal":"Morsali S"},{"literal":"Sabahi Z"},{"literal":"Kakaei J"},{"literal":"Hakimzadeh Z"},{"literal":"Hamidi S"},{"literal":"Gholipour-Khalili E"},{"literal":"Sanaie S"},{"literal":"Talebi M"},{"literal":"Naseri A"}],"citation-key":"morsalisClinicalEfficacySafety2023","container-title":"Inflammopharmacology","DOI":"10.1007/s10787-023-01271-4","ISSN":"0925-4692","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"2213-2220","title":"Clinical efficacy and safety of melatonin supplementation in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10787-023-01271-4","volume":"31"},{"id":"morshedimImmunomodulatoryAntiinflammatoryEffects2019","abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and autoimmune neurological disorder which leads to demyelination.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of modified anti-inflammatory diet on fatigue, quality of life, and inflammatory markers among patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 100 patients with RRMS. The patients were randomly divided into the diet group (anti-inflammatory diet) or the control group (healthy diet recommendations) for 12 weeks. Fatigue and quality of life were assessed by Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQoL-54), respectively. Anthropometric measures and inflammatory biomarkers, including Interleukin 17 (IL-17), Interleukin 4 (IL-4), and high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), were assessed at baseline and end of the study. RESULTS: The results showed a significant improvement in MFIS as well as in physical and mental components of MSQoL-54 (p = 0.001, p = 0.015, and p = 0.003, respectively) in the diet group compared to the control group.

CONCLUSION: Modified anti-inflammatory diet could improve fatigue and quality of life and increase IL-4 level.","author":[{"literal":"Mousavi-Shirazi-Fard Z"},{"literal":"Mazloom Z"},{"literal":"Izadi S"},{"literal":"Fararouei M"}],"citation-key":"mousavi-shirazi-fardzEffectsModifiedAntiinflammatory2021","container-title":"Int J Neurosci","DOI":"10.1080/00207454.2020.1750398","ISSN":"0020-7454","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"657-665","title":"The effects of modified anti-inflammatory diet on fatigue, quality of life, and inflammatory biomarkers in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients: a randomized clinical trial","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2020.1750398","volume":"131"},{"id":"moyonNeuralStemCells2023","abstract":"A major therapeutic goal in demyelinating diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, is to improve remyelination, thereby restoring effective axon conduction and preventing neurodegeneration. In the adult central nervous system (CNS), parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (pOPCs) and, to a lesser extent, pre-existing oligodendrocytes (OLs) and oligodendrocytes generated from neural stem cells (NSCs) in the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) are capable of forming new myelin sheaths. Due to their self-renewal capabilities and the ability of their progeny to migrate widely within the CNS, NSCs represent an additional source of remyelinating cells that may be targeted to supplement repair by pOPCs. However, in demyelinating disorders and disease models, the NSC contribution to myelin repair is modest and most evident in regions close to the SVZ. We hypothesized that NSC-derived cells may compete with OPCs to remyelinate the same axons, with pOPCs serving as the primary remyelinating cells due to their widespread distribution within the adult CNS, thereby limiting the contribution of NSC-progeny. Here, we have used a dual reporter, genetic fate mapping strategy, to characterize the contribution of pOPCs and NSC-derived OLs to remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination. We confirmed that, while pOPCs are the main remyelinating cells in the corpus callosum, NSC-derived cells are also activated and recruited to demyelinating lesions. Blocking pOPC differentiation genetically, resulted in a significant increase in the recruitment NSC-derived cells into the demyelinated corpus callosum and their differentiation into OLs. These results strongly suggest that pOPCs and NSC-progeny compete to repair white matter lesions. They underscore the potential significance of targeting NSCs to improve repair when the contribution of pOPCs is insufficient to affect full remyelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Moyon","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Holloman","given":"Mara"},{"family":"Salzer","given":"James L."}],"citation-key":"moyonNeuralStemCells2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

They are poised to revolutionize neuroregeneration by unraveling the nervous system's complexities. However, research on AI/ML in neuroregeneration is fragmented, necessitating a comprehensive review. Adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations, 19 English-language papers focusing on AI/ML in neuroregeneration were selected from a total of 247. Two researchers independently conducted data extraction and quality assessment using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) 2018. Eight studies were deemed high quality, 10 moderate, and four low. Primary goals included diagnosing neurological disorders (35%), robotic rehabilitation (18%), and drug discovery (12% each). Methods ranged from analyzing imaging data (24%) to animal models (24%) and electronic health records (12%). Deep learning accounted for 41% of AI/ML techniques, while standard ML algorithms constituted 29%. The review underscores the growing interest in AI/ML for neuroregenerative medicine, with increasing publications. These technologies aid in diagnosing diseases and facilitating functional recovery through robotics and targeted stimulation.

Multiple studies have reported that cannabis administration in multiple sclerosis patients is associated with decreased symptom severity. This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of cannabis abuse in multiple sclerosis cases and to evaluate the effect of cannabis on serum cytokines in such cases. Patients and Methods. A total of 150 multiple sclerosis cases along with 150 healthy controls were included during the study period. All cases were subjected to history taking, neurological examination, and routine investigations. Cases were asked about cannabis intake which was confirmed by a urine test. Serum cytokines including IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IL-22, IFN-γ, IFN-β1, and TNF-α were ordered for all cases and controls. Results. Twenty-eight cases were cannabis abusers (MS/cannabis group, 18.67%). The remaining 122 cases represented the MS group. There was no significant difference between the three groups regarding age, disease duration, or MS type. Male gender was more predominant in the MS/cannabis group, and the number of relapses was significantly lower in the same group. Fifteen cases (53.6%) reported that their symptoms were improved by cannabis. Proinflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated in the MS group compared to the MS/cannabis and control groups. Additionally, anti-inflammatory cytokines had significantly lower values in the MS group compared to the MS/cannabis and control groups. Most clinical symptoms were significantly improved in the MS/cannabis group compared to the MS group apart from sexual dysfunction, bladder symptoms, and visual disturbances. Mild side effects of cannabis were also reported. Conclusion.

to conduct a systematic review to examine whether there is an association between antioxidants supplements and cognitive performance in MS patients. Background: Cognitive dysfunction is a debilitating characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS) that affects approximately 60% of patients. To date, the only effective treatments for cognitive decline are cognitive rehabilitation and exercise training. While previous studies reported the beneficial effect of antioxidants on MS patients, several other studies investigated the effect of antioxidant supplements on the cognitive performance of MS patients. Design/Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science for the identification of relevant studies in November 2021. We included control trials, cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies which showed the effect of any type of antioxidants on cognitive performance in MS patients. Results: After screening 12 papers were included in our study. Our review included three studies that examined the effect of ginkgo Biloba on cognitive performance, two examined the Mediterranean diet, and remained studies each investigated the vitamin A, Omega 5, Omega 3, estriol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), Boswellia papyrifera, and paleolithic diet. Overall, it seems that there were no benefits for antioxidant administration on cognitive performance in MS patients. Conclusions: It is complicated to draw a conclusion regarding the effect of an antioxidant-containing regimen and cognitive performance in MS patients. Findings from included studies failed to unequivocally support the beneficial effect of antioxidant consumption on cognitive performance in MS patients.","author":[{"literal":"Nabizadeh F"}],"citation-key":"nabizadehfAntioxidantSupplementsCognition2023","container-title":"Neurology","DOI":"10.1212/WNL.0000000000202806","ISSN":"1526-632X","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"title":"Antioxidant supplements and cognition in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review (P14-3.003)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000202806","volume":"100"},{"id":"naeemNebivololElicitsNeuroprotective2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background and Aim\n              Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating neurodegenerative inflammatory disease affecting mainly young adults.

While brain lesions have gained significant attention in MS research, the involvement of spinal cord lesions in MS is relatively understudied. This is largely owed to the variability in spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition protocols, high individual anatomical differences, the complex morphology and size of spinal cord lesions - and lastly, the scarcity of labeled datasets required to develop robust segmentation tools. As a result, automatic segmentation of spinal cord MS lesions remains a significant challenge. Although some segmentation tools exist for spinal cord lesions, most have been developed using sagittal T2-weighted (T2w) sequences primarily focusing on cervical spines. With the growing importance of spinal cord imaging in MS, axial T2w scans are becoming increasingly relevant due to their superior sensitivity in detecting lesions compared to sagittal acquisition protocols. However, most existing segmentation methods struggle to effectively generalize to axial sequences due to differences in image characteristics caused by the highly anisotropic spinal cord scans. To address these challenges, we developed a robust, open-source lesion segmentation tool tailored specifically for axial T2w scans covering the whole spinal cord. We investigated key factors influencing lesion segmentation, including the impact of stitching together individually acquired spinal regions, straightening the spinal cord, and comparing the effectiveness of 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Drawing on these insights, we trained a multi-center model using an extensive dataset of 582 MS patients, resulting in a dataset comprising an entirety of 2,167 scans. We empirically evaluated the model’s segmentation performance across various spinal segments for lesions with varying sizes. Our model significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, providing consistent segmentation across cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions. To support the broader research community, we integrate our model into the widely-used Spinal Cord Toolbox (v7.0 and above), making it accessible via the command sct deepseg -task seg sc ms lesion axial t2w -i &lt;path-to-image.nii.gz&gt;.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by Bavarian State Ministry for Science and Art (Collaborative Bilateral Research Program Bavaria - Quebec: AI in medicine (grant F.4-V0134.K5.1/86/34), European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (101045128-iBack-epic-ERC2021-COG), Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Nature and Technologie (FRQNT) Doctoral Training Scholarship and DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) Short-term Research Grant.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Institutional Review Board (Ethikkommission) of the School of Medicine and Health, TU Munich, approved the retrospective use of anonymized local MR studies of Multiple Sclerosis patients for this study.

Public relations and communication activities emerged to be extremely important in the successful development of this project.  To gain insights into the contributions of these activities, we divided the public relations and communication activities for the project into three phases based on the situations surrounding the project.  Prior to the start of the cohort study (Phase I), a cooperative relationship was established with a focus on concluding cooperation agreements with local governments.  Until the participants reached the target number (Phase II), we actively communicated with the media to publicize the project.  During the phase in which use of the constructed biobank is promoted (Phase III), for ensuring the industrial utilization of the biobank, visits from the industry are promoted.  Throughout the execution of these activities, we explored the best strategies for building relationships with multiple stakeholders like local government, media and industry.  By paying attention to these phases that have been changing according to the project’s progress, we were able to adapt the strategies and methods of public relations and communication.  The success of these activities has enabled the overall project to progress smoothly.  We hope that the process of designing our project’s public relations and communication activities will be useful for other similar initiatives.","author":[{"family":"Nagami","given":"Fuji"},{"family":"Kuriki","given":"Miho"},{"family":"Koreeda","given":"Sachie"},{"family":"Kageyama","given":"Maiko"},{"family":"Shimizu","given":"Osamu"},{"family":"Toda","given":"Soichiro"},{"family":"Hozawa","given":"Atsushi"},{"family":"Kuriyama","given":"Shinichi"},{"family":"Osumi","given":"Noriko"},{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Masayuki"}],"citation-key":"nagamiPublicRelationsCommunication2020","container-title":"The Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine","DOI":"10.1620/tjem.250.253","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"253-262","source":"J-Stage","title":"Public Relations and Communication Strategies in Construction of Large-Scale Cohorts and Biobank: Practice in the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project","title-short":"Public Relations and Communication Strategies in Construction of Large-Scale Cohorts and Biobank","type":"article-journal","volume":"250"},{"id":"nagataTwocarbaCyclicPhosphatidic2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nagata","given":"Wataru"},{"family":"Gotoh","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Koizumi","given":"Akiho"},{"family":"Fukasawa","given":"Keiko"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Keiichi"},{"family":"Satoh","given":"Yasushi"},{"family":"Ishizuka","given":"Toshiaki"}],"citation-key":"nagataTwocarbaCyclicPhosphatidic2023","container-title":"Human Cell","container-title-short":"Human Cell","DOI":"10.1007/s13577-023-00964-w","ISSN":"1749-0774","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,4]]},"language":"en","page":"2006-2015","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Two-carba cyclic phosphatidic acid treatment promotes phenotypic switch from M1 to M2 microglia and prevents behavioral abnormalities in a mouse model of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13577-023-00964-w","volume":"36"},{"id":"nakamotoNobiletinSuppressesDevelopment2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nakamoto","given":"Akiko"},{"family":"Hirabayashi","given":"Yuwa"},{"family":"Anzaki","given":"Chieri"},{"family":"Nakamoto","given":"Mariko"},{"family":"Shuto","given":"Emi"},{"family":"Sakai","given":"Tohru"}],"citation-key":"nakamotoNobiletinSuppressesDevelopment2021","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Biochemistry and Nutrition","container-title-short":"J.

Oligodendrocyte mitochondria supply the bulk of energy and carbon‐chain backbones required for lipid synthesis. The sparsity of mitochondria in the myelin sheath suggests that tight regulation of mitochondrial trafficking is crucial for their efficient distribution in the cell. In particular, retention of mitochondria at axoglial junctions would support local lipid synthesis and membrane remodeling during myelination. How mitochondrial docking in oligodendrocytes is regulated is not known. Our findings indicate that syntaphilin (SNPH), a mitochondrial docking protein that has been characterized in neurons, is expressed by oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocytes in vitro and present in the myelin sheath in vivo. We have previously reported that bath application of netrin‐1 promotes the elaboration of myelin basic protein‐positive membranes, and that localized presentation of a netrin‐1 coated microbead results in rapid accumulation of mitochondria at the site of oligodendrocyte‐bead adhesion. Here we show that netrin‐1 increases the redistribution of SNPH to oligodendrocyte processes during the expansion of myelin basic protein‐positive membranes and that SNPH clusters at the oligodendrocyte plasma membrane at sites of adhesion with netrin‐1‐coated beads where mitochondria are retained. These findings suggest roles for SNPH in oligodendrocytes regulating netrin‐1‐mediated mitochondrial docking and myelin membrane expansion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Diane S."},{"family":"Gothié","given":"Jean‐David M."},{"family":"Kornfeld","given":"Samantha F."},{"family":"Kothary","given":"Rashmi"},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"Timothy E."}],"citation-key":"nakamuraExpressionSubcellularLocalization2023","container-title":"Glia","container-title-short":"Glia","DOI":"10.1002/glia.24425","ISSN":"0894-1491, 1098-1136","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10]]},"language":"en","page":"2343-2355","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Expression and subcellular localization of mitochondrial docking protein, syntaphilin, in oligodendrocytes and <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">CNS</span> myelin sheath","title-short":"Expression and subcellular localization of mitochondrial docking protein, syntaphilin, in oligodendrocytes and <span style=\"font-variant","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/glia.24425","volume":"71"},{"id":"nakamuraIbudilastReducesSlowly2024","abstract":"Background:\n              Ibudilast has shown beneficial effects on several imaging outcomes in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS).

Unfortunately, remyelination, as a regenerative process, is often insufficient to prevent axonal loss and improve neurological deficits after demyelination. Currently, there are still no effective therapeutic tools to restore neurological function, but interestingly, emerging studies prove the beneficial effects of lipid supplementation in a wide variety of pathological processes in the human body.

Loss of myelin leads to neurological dysfunction and, if myelin repair fails, neurodegeneration of the denuded axons. Virtually all treatments for MS act by suppressing immune function, but do not alter myelin repair outcomes or long-term disability. Excitingly, the diabetes drug metformin, a potent activator of the cellular “energy sensor” AMPK complex, has recently been reported to enhance recovery from demyelination. In aged mice, metformin can restore responsiveness of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to pro-differentiation cues, enhancing their ability to differentiate and thus repair myelin. However, metformin’s influence on young oligodendroglia remains poorly understood. Here we investigated metformin’s effect on the temporal dynamics of differentiation and metabolism in young, healthy oligodendroglia and in oligodendroglia following myelin damage in young adult mice. Our findings reveal that metformin accelerates early stages of myelin repair following cuprizone-induced myelin damage. Metformin treatment of both isolated OPCs and oligodendrocytes altered cellular bioenergetics, but in distinct ways,\n              suppressing\n              oxidative phosphorylation and\n              enhancing\n              glycolysis in OPCs, but\n              enhancing\n              oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in both immature and mature oligodendrocytes. In addition, metformin accelerated the differentiation of OPCs to oligodendrocytes in an AMPK-dependent manner that was also dependent on metformin’s ability to modulate cell metabolism. In summary, metformin dramatically alters metabolism and accelerates oligodendroglial differentiation both in health and following myelin damage. This finding broadens our knowledge of metformin’s potential to promote myelin repair in MS and in other diseases with myelin loss or altered myelination dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Narine","given":"Mohanlall"},{"family":"Azmi","given":"Maryam A."},{"family":"Umali","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Volz","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Colognato","given":"Holly"}],"citation-key":"narineAMPKActivatorMetformin2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

In this preliminary experiment, we used seven groups of six rats: the control group received vehicle, the two positive control groups were treated with either sodium salicylate (300 mg/kg) intraperitoneal (i.p.) or methyl prednisolon (MPN 10 mg/kg) i.p., while the test groups were treated with a solution centrifuged MS14 (SANT 100 mg/kg) and suspension of MS14 (SUSP 100, 150, 300 mg/kg) i.p. After thirty minutes, paw volume was measured by plethysmometer and immediately formalin solution was injected subcutaneously into the hind paw and after an hour, inflamed paw volume was measured. In days 2-8, the inflamed paw volume was measured and immediately drugs were injected i.p. The anti-inflammatory effect of MPN was significant only on days 5 and 6. The anti-inflammatory effect of SS was significant only on the 6th day, while the anti-inflammatory effect of SANT MS14 (100 mg/kg) was also significant only on the 6th day. SUSP MS14 (150 mg/kg) significantly reduced edema from second to 6th day. Intra-peritoneal injection of SUSP MS14 with 300 mg/kg was toxic, so excluded from the study. This research indicates that the MS14 possesses an anti-inflammatory effect after intra-peritoneal administration. Comparative anti-inflammatory effects of MS14 with Glucocorticoids in this study, may justify a possible mechanism for its action in multiple sclerosis, if further studies will provid strong statistically confirmatory effects in animals and safety human trials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Naseri","given":"Mohsen"},{"family":"Rezaeizadeh","given":"Hossein"},{"family":"Mirghazanfari","given":"Mahdi"},{"family":"Taheripanah","given":"Taiebeh"},{"family":"Bararpoor","given":"Zahra"},{"family":"Ashayeri","given":"Neda"},{"family":"Asghari","given":"Majid"},{"family":"Shahi","given":"Abbas Talebi Mazrae"},{"family":"Emadi","given":"Fatemeh"},{"family":"Moghaddam","given":"Parvaneh Mohseni"},{"family":"Nejad","given":"Abbas Hashemi"},{"family":"Ghaffari","given":"Farzaneh"}],"citation-key":"naseriAntiinflammatoryActivityNatural2021","container-title":"European Journal of Translational Myology","container-title-short":"Eur J Transl Myol","DOI":"10.4081/ejtm.2022.10169","ISSN":"2037-7460, 2037-7452","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,24]]},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Anti-inflammatory activity of a natural herbal-marine drug (MS14 - SANT and SUSP) compared to sodium salicylate or methylprednisolone in a rat model for multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pagepressjournals.org/index.php/bam/article/view/10169","volume":"32"},{"id":"nasermoghadasiImportanceAutologousHematopoietic2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Naser Moghadasi","given":"Abdorreza"}],"citation-key":"nasermoghadasiImportanceAutologousHematopoietic2023","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Journal of Clinical Neuroscience","DOI":"10.1016/j.jocn.2023.05.020","ISSN":"09675868","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","page":"166","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The importance of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in severe cases of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0967586823001327","volume":"115"},{"id":"nasl-khamenehImmunomodulatoryEffectsAlltrans2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nasl-Khameneh","given":"Ateke Mousavi"},{"family":"Mirshafiey","given":"Abbas"},{"family":"Moghadasi","given":"Abdorreza Naser"},{"family":"Yekaninejad","given":"Mir Saeed"},{"family":"Parastouei","given":"Karim"},{"family":"Nejati","given":"Shima"},{"family":"Saboor-Yaraghi","given":"Ali Akbar"}],"citation-key":"nasl-khamenehImmunomodulatoryEffectsAlltrans2023","container-title":"Neurological Research","container-title-short":"Neurological Research","DOI":"10.1080/01616412.2022.2162222","ISSN":"0161-6412, 1743-1328","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,3]]},"language":"en","page":"510-519","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The immunomodulatory effects of all-trans retinoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid combination treatment on the expression of IL-2, IL-4, T-bet, and GATA3 genes in PBMCs of multiple sclerosis patients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01616412.2022.2162222","volume":"45"},{"id":"nasrnezhadPiperineImprovesExperimental2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nasrnezhad","given":"Reza"},{"family":"Halalkhor","given":"Sohrab"},{"family":"Sadeghi","given":"Farzin"},{"family":"Pourabdolhossein","given":"Fereshteh"}],"citation-key":"nasrnezhadPiperineImprovesExperimental2021","container-title":"Molecular Neurobiology","container-title-short":"Mol Neurobiol","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-021-02497-5","ISSN":"0893-7648, 1559-1182","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"language":"en","page":"5473-5493","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Piperine Improves Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis Rats Through its Neuroprotective, Anti-inflammatory, and Antioxidant Effects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12035-021-02497-5","volume":"58"},{"id":"nathooSusceptibilityWeightedImaging2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nathoo","given":"Nabeela"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Rogers","given":"James A."},{"family":"Yong","given":"V.

Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) is a medical intervention where a patient is infused with healthy stem cells with the purpose of resetting their immune system. SCT shows remyelinating and immunomodulatory functions in MS patients, representing a potential therapeutic option. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis that included randomized control trials (RCTs) of SCT in MS patients to investigate its clinical efficacy and safety, excluding observational and non-English studies. After systematically searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library until January 7, 2024, nine RCTs, including 422 patients, were eligible. We assessed the risk of bias (ROB) in these RCTs using Cochrane ROB Tool 1. Data were synthesized using Review Manager version 5.4 and OpenMeta Analyst software. We also conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses. SCT significantly improved patients expanded disability status scale after 2 months (N = 39, MD =  − 0.57, 95% CI [− 1.08, − 0.06],\n              p\n               = 0.03). SCT also reduced brain lesion volume (N = 136, MD = − 7.05, 95% CI [− 10.69, − 3.4],\n              p\n               = 0.0002). The effect on EDSS at 6 and 12 months, timed 25-foot walk (T25-FW), and brain lesions number was nonsignificant. Significant adverse events (AEs) included local reactions at MSCs infusion site (N = 25, RR = 2.55, 95% CI [1.08, 6.03],\n              p\n               = 0.034) and hematological disorders in patients received immunosuppression and autologous hematopoietic SCT (AHSCT) (N = 16, RR = 2.33, 95% CI [1.23, 4.39],\n              p\n               = 0.009). SCT can improve the disability of MS patients and reduce their brain lesion volume. The transplantation was generally safe and tolerated, with no mortality or significant serious AEs, except for infusion site reactions after mesenchymal SCT and hematological AEs after AHSCT. However, generalizing our results is limited by the sparse number of RCTs conducted on AHSCT. Our protocol was registered on PROSPERO with a registration number: CRD42022324141.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nawar","given":"Asmaa Ahmed"},{"family":"Farid","given":"Aml Mostafa"},{"family":"Wally","given":"Rim"},{"family":"Tharwat","given":"Engy K."},{"family":"Sameh","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Elkaramany","given":"Yomna"},{"family":"Asla","given":"Moamen Mostafa"},{"family":"Kamel","given":"Walaa A."}],"citation-key":"nawarEfficacySafetyStem2024","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-024-62726-4","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,31]]},"language":"en","page":"12545","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Efficacy and safety of stem cell transplantation for multiple sclerosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","title-short":"Efficacy and safety of stem cell transplantation for multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-62726-4","volume":"14"},{"id":"nazariAmelioratingEffect6week2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nazari","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Kordi","given":"Mohamadreza"},{"family":"Minasian","given":"Vazgen"},{"family":"Saffar Kohneh Quchan","given":"Amir Hossein"}],"citation-key":"nazariAmelioratingEffect6week2022","container-title":"Iranian Journal of Basic Medical Sciences","container-title-short":"Iranian Journal of Basic Medical Sciences","DOI":"10.22038/ijbms.2022.65117.14335","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"eng","source":"DOI.org (CSL JSON)","title":"Ameliorating effect of 6-week swimming exercise on mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by reducing fetuin-A and increasing AMPK & NAD⁺ levels in liver tissue","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.22038/ijbms.2022.65117.14335","volume":"25"},{"id":"nehzatComparableEfficacySafety2021","abstract":"Background. The aim of this observational study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of two approved oral disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in patients with remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis (RRMS): dimethyl fumarate (DMF) vs. teriflunomide (TRF). Methods. A total of 159 RRMS patients (82 on TRF and 77 on DMF) were included. The expanded disability status scale (EDSS), confirmed disability improvement (CDI), confirmed disability progression (CDP), and annualized relapse rate (ARR) were evaluated for the two-year period prior to enrollment in our study. The drug-associated adverse effects (AEs) were recorded. We conducted propensity matching score to compare the efficacy between TRF and DMF. Results. After matching for the confounders, TRF- and DMF-treated groups were not different in terms of EDSS (\n              \n                \n                  P\n                \n              \n              value = 0.54), CDI (\n              \n                \n                  P\n                \n              \n              value = 0.80), CDP (\n              \n                \n                  P\n                \n              \n              value = 0.39), and ARR (\n              \n                \n                  P\n                \n              \n              value >0.05). TRF discontinuation occurred in 2 patients (2.43%) due to mediastinitis and liver dysfunction, while a patient (1.29%) discontinued DMF due to depression. Incidence rate of AEs in the TRF-treated group was 81.4%: hair thinning (hair loss) (62.9%), nail loss (20.9%), and elevated aminotransferase (14.8%) were the most common AEs; in DMF-treated patients, AEs were 88.2% with predominance of flushing (73.2%), pruritus (16.9%), and abdominal pain (16.9%). Conclusion. Based on our findings, DMF is as efficacious and safe as TRF for the treatment of RRMS in our Iranian study population. Multicentric studies need to corroborate these findings in other populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nehzat","given":"Nasim"},{"family":"Mirmosayyeb","given":"Omid"},{"family":"Barzegar","given":"Mahdi"},{"family":"Vosoughi","given":"Reza"},{"family":"Fazeli","given":"Erfane"},{"family":"Shaygannejad","given":"Vahid"}],"citation-key":"nehzatComparableEfficacySafety2021","container-title":"Neurology Research International","container-title-short":"Neurology Research International","DOI":"10.1155/2021/6679197","editor":[{"family":"Bronstein","given":"Jeff"}],"ISSN":"2090-1860, 2090-1852","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,15]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1-8","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Comparable Efficacy and Safety of Teriflunomide versus Dimethyl Fumarate for the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/nri/2021/6679197/","volume":"2021"},{"id":"nejadEffectAtomoxetineCognitive2023","abstract":"Background: Recent research shows that most of the patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have cognitive-like disorders.

According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 52 participants were involved in the study and then randomly divided in two groups of 26. Experimental group was treated with atomoxetine and the control group was treated with placebo. The Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis (MACFIMS) test was performed for assessment at the beginning and after 3 months. The California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), the CVLT-delay, the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R), and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) were used to evaluate the CI and changes following medication.

Additionally understanding the impact of fitness, including motor skill fitness, on brain structure remains a gap in knowledge. In this study, we examine a longitudinal cohort of PD patients using advanced microstructural analysis derived from diffusion MRI, alongside volumetric, and connectivity components. These imaging metrics are compared to comprehensive cognitive and motor skill fitness metrics. Though the volumetric components well characterize change across the longitudinal timescale, the microstructural analysis was related to a number of composite cognitive scores including attention, executive function, cognition, language, as well as the level of motor skill fitness. We further assess the connectivity of the cholinergic basal forebrain, particularly the nucleus basalis of Meynert in area 4 (CH4), and find that connectivity between CH4 and the thalamus is associated with latent motor skill fitness. The pattern of microstructural results suggests that increased cellularity, potentially from astrocytic glial cells, may support reduced cognitive decline in individuals with PD as well as higher motor skill fitness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the US Army/DoD (W81XWH-18-1-0666: Petzinger, Scheihser, Holschneider, PIs) 09/14/2019-09/14/2023 entitled \"Investigating Exercise-induced Neuroplasticity and its Mechanisms in Parkinson's Disease: Targeting Executive Function and Brain Circuitry\"Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Data were collected for this study under the approval of the Health Sciences Internal Review Board of the University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, Study ID: HS-18-00323I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Myelin is an insulating layer that allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along neurons. If myelin is damaged, as in chronic demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), these impulses slow down. Remyelination by oligodendrocytes is often ineffective in MS, in part because of the failure of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to differentiate into mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes. The process of oligodendrocyte differentiation is tightly controlled by several regulatory networks involving transcription factors, intracellular signaling pathways, and extrinsic cues. Understanding the factors that regulate oligodendrocyte development is essential for the discovery of new therapeutic strategies capable of enhancing remyelination. Over the past decade, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of oligodendrocyte development, exerting effects on cell specification, proliferation, differentiation, and myelination.

However, the lack of fully efficient responses to the available treatments obviously shows the need to search for novel therapeutic candidates that will not exclusively target neurons or immune cells. Accumulating knowledge on epilepsy and MS in humans and analysis of relevant animal models, reveals that astrocytes are promising therapeutic candidates to target as they participate in the modulation of the neuroinflammatory response in both diseases from the initial stages and may play an important role in their development. Indeed, astrocytes respond to reactive immune cells and contribute to the neuronal hyperactivity in the inflamed brain. Mechanistically, these astrocytic cell to cell interactions are fundamentally mediated by the purinergic signalling and involve metabotropic P2Y1 receptors in case of astrocyte interactions with neurons, while ionotropic P2X7 receptors are mainly involved in astrocyte interactions with autoreactive immune cells.

To explore the effects of Shh/Smo on differentiation and myelination in vivo, we developed a highly quantifiable model by transplanting oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in the retina. We find that myelination is greatly enhanced upon cyclopamine treatment and hypothesize that Shh/Smo could promote OPC proliferation to subsequently inhibit differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that the genetic activation of Smo significantly increased numbers of OPCs and decreased oligodendrocyte differentiation when we examined the corpus callosum during development and after cuprizone demyelination and remyelination. However, upon loss of function with the conditional ablation of Smo, myelination in the same scenarios are unchanged. Taken together, our present findings suggest that the Shh pathway is sufficient to maintain OPCs in an undifferentiated state, but is not necessary for myelination and remyelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Nocera","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"Marchena","given":"Miguel A."},{"family":"Fernández‐Gómez","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"Gómez‐Martín","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Sánchez‐Jiménez","given":"Estefanía"},{"family":"Macías‐Castellano","given":"Alba"},{"family":"Laó","given":"Yolanda"},{"family":"Cordano","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Gómez‐Torres","given":"Óscar"},{"family":"Luján","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"De Castro","given":"Fernando"}],"citation-key":"noceraActivationShhSmo2024","container-title":"Glia","container-title-short":"Glia","DOI":"10.1002/glia.24540","ISSN":"0894-1491, 1098-1136","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8]]},"language":"en","page":"1469-1483","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Activation of Shh/Smo is sufficient to maintain oligodendrocyte precursor cells in an undifferentiated state and is not necessary for myelin formation and (re)myelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/glia.24540","volume":"72"},{"id":"norbomProbingAutismADHD2024","abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are neurodevelopmental conditions that share genetic etiology and frequently co-occur. Given this comorbidity and well-established clinical heterogeneity, identifying individuals with similar brain signatures may be valuable for predicting clinical outcomes and tailoring treatment strategies. Cortical myelination is a prominent developmental process, and its disruption is a candidate mechanism for both disorders. Yet, no studies have attempted to identify subtypes using T1w/T2w-ratio, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based proxy for intracortical myelin. Moreover, cortical variability arises from numerous biological pathways, and multimodal approaches can integrate cortical metrics into a single network. We analyzed data from 310 individuals aged 2.6-23.6 years, obtained from the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental (POND) Network consisting of individuals diagnosed with ASD (n=136), ADHD (n=100), and typically developing (TD) individuals (n=74). We first tested for differences in T1w/T2w-ratio between diagnostic categories and controls. We then performed unimodal (T1w/T2w-ratio) and multimodal (T1w/T2w-ratio, cortical thickness, and surface area) spectral clustering to identify diagnostic-blind subgroups. Linear models revealed no statistically significant case-control differences in T1w/T2w-ratio. Unimodal clustering mostly isolated single individual- or minority clusters, driven by image quality and intensity outliers. Multimodal clustering suggested three distinct subgroups, which transcended diagnostic boundaries, showing separate cortical patterns but similar clinical and cognitive profiles. T1w/T2w-ratio features were the most relevant for demarcation, followed by surface area. While our analysis revealed no significant case-control differences, multimodal clustering incorporating the T1w/T2w-ratio among cortical features holds promise for identifying biologically similar subsets of individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Research Council of Norway The South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority The ERA-Net Cofund through the ERA PerMed project IMPLEMENT, and the European Research Council under the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and Innovation program (ERC StG Grant #802998).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The ethics committee of the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada gave ethical approval for this work (1000012230).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

We report the first Phase 3 placebo-controlled study of an oral antispasticity agent to use an enriched study design. METHODS: A 19-week follow-up, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in subjects with multiple sclerosis spasticity not fully relieved with current antispasticity therapy. Subjects were treated with nabiximols, as add-on therapy, in a single-blind manner for 4weeks, after which those achieving an improvement in spasticity of ≥20% progressed to a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled phase. RESULTS: Of the 572 subjects enrolled, 272 achieved a ≥20% improvement after 4weeks of single-blind treatment, and 241 were randomized. The primary end-point was the difference between treatments in the mean spasticity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in the randomized, controlled phase of the study. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed a highly significant difference in favour of nabiximols (P=0.0002). Secondary end-points of responder analysis, Spasm Frequency Score, Sleep Disturbance NRS Patient, Carer and Clinician Global Impression of Change were all significant in favour of nabiximols. CONCLUSIONS: The enriched study design provides a method of determining the efficacy and safety of nabiximols in a way that more closely reflects proposed clinical practice, by limiting exposure to those patients who are likely to benefit from it. Hence, the difference between active and placebo should be a reflection of efficacy and safety in the population intended for treatment.","author":[{"literal":"Novotna A"},{"literal":"Mares J"},{"literal":"Ratcliffe S"},{"literal":"Novakova I"},{"literal":"Vachova M"},{"literal":"Zapletalova O"},{"literal":"Gasperini C"},{"literal":"Pozzilli C"},{"literal":"Cefaro L"},{"literal":"Comi G"},{"literal":"Rossi P"},{"literal":"Ambler Z"},{"literal":"Stelmasiak Z"},{"literal":"Erdmann A"},{"literal":"Montalban X"},{"literal":"Klimek A"},{"literal":"Davies P"}],"citation-key":"novotnaaRandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled2011","container-title":"Eur J Neurol","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-1331.2010.03328.x","ISSN":"1351-5101","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"1122-31","title":"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, enriched-design study of nabiximols* (Sativex(®) ), as add-on therapy, in subjects with refractory spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-1331.2010.03328.x","volume":"18"},{"id":"nuesslein-hildesheimRemibrutinibLOU064Inhibits2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key signaling node in B cell receptor (BCR) and Fc receptor (FcR) signaling. BTK inhibitors (BTKi) are an emerging oral treatment option for patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS).

The impact of remibrutinib on B cell-driven EAE pathology was determined after immunization with human myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (HuMOG). The efficacy on myeloid cell and microglia driven neuroinflammation was determined in the RatMOG EAE. In addition, we assessed the relationship of efficacy to BTK occupancy in tissue, ex vivo T cell response, as well as single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in brain and spinal cord tissue.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Remibrutinib inhibited B cell-dependent HuMOG EAE in dose-dependent manner and strongly reduced neurological symptoms. At the efficacious oral dose of 30 mg/kg, remibrutinib showed strong BTK occupancy in the peripheral immune organs and in the brain of EAE mice. Ex vivo MOG-specific T cell recall response was reduced, but not polyclonal T cell response, indicating absence of non-specific T cell inhibition. Remibrutinib also inhibited RatMOG EAE, suggesting that myeloid cell and microglia inhibition contribute to its efficacy in EAE. Remibrutinib did not reduce B cells, total Ig levels nor MOG-specific antibody response. In brain and spinal cord tissue a clear anti-inflammatory effect in microglia was detected by scRNA-seq.

One such gene linked to MS susceptibility and known to regulate immune function is the self-ligand immune cell receptor SLAMF7.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                We subjected WT and SLAMF7\n                −/−\n                mice to multiple EAE models, compared disease severity, and comprehensively profiled the CNS immune landscape of these mice. We identified all SLAMF7-expressing CNS immune cells and compared the entire CNS immune niche between genotypes.

Adoptive transfer studies involving the transfer of WT and SLAMF7\n                −/−\n                B cells into B cell-deficient mice (μMT) were also performed.

Absence of SLAMF7 did not grossly alter the CNS immune landscape, but allowed for altered immune cell subset infiltration during EAE in a model-dependent manner. Global lack of SLAMF7 expression increased myeloid cell activation states along with augmented T cell anti-MOG immunity.

Inflammatory reactions can lead to life-threatening conditions such as septic shock, while chronic inflammation has the potential to worsen the condition of body tissues and ultimately lead to significant impairment of their functionality. Although the central nervous system has long been considered immune privileged to peripheral immune responses, recent research has shown that strong immune responses in the periphery also affect the brain, leading to reactive microglia, which belong to the innate immune system and reside in the brain, and neuroinflammation. The inflammatory response is primarily a protective mechanism to defend against pathogens and tissue damage. However, excessive and chronic inflammation can have negative effects on neuronal structure and function. Neuroinflammation underlies the pathogenesis of many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and can accelerate their progression. Consequently, targeting inflammatory signaling pathways offers potential therapeutic strategies for various neuropathological conditions, particularly Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, by curbing inflammation. Here the blood–brain barrier is a major hurdle for potential therapeutic strategies, therefore it would be highly advantageous to foster and utilize brain innate anti-inflammatory mechanisms. The tricarboxylic acid cycle-derived metabolite itaconate is highly upregulated in activated macrophages and has been shown to act as an immunomodulator with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial functions. Mesaconate, an isomer of itaconate, similarly reduces the inflammatory response in macrophages. Nevertheless, most studies have focused on its esterified forms and its peripheral effects, while its influence on the CNS remained largely unexplored. Therefore, this study investigated the immunomodulatory and therapeutic potential of endogenously synthesized itaconate and its isomer mesaconate in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammatory processes. Our results show that both itaconate and mesaconate reduce LPS-induced neuroinflammation, as evidenced by lower levels of inflammatory mediators, reduced microglial reactivity and a rescue of synaptic plasticity, the cellular correlate of learning and memory processes in the brain. Overall, this study emphasizes that both itaconate and mesaconate have therapeutic potential for neuroinflammatory processes in the brain and are of remarkable importance due to their endogenous origin and production, which usually leads to high tolerance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ohm","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Hosseini","given":"Shirin"},{"family":"Lonnemann","given":"Niklas"},{"family":"He","given":"Wei"},{"family":"More","given":"Tushar"},{"family":"Goldmann","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Medina","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Hiller","given":"Karsten"},{"family":"Korte","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"ohmPotentialTherapeuticRole2024","container-title":"Journal of Neuroinflammation","container-title-short":"J Neuroinflammation","DOI":"10.1186/s12974-024-03188-3","ISSN":"1742-2094","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,20]]},"language":"en","page":"207","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The potential therapeutic role of itaconate and mesaconate on the detrimental effects of LPS-induced neuroinflammation in the brain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-024-03188-3","volume":"21"},{"id":"ohNonsaponinPanaxGinseng2025","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Oh","given":"Jinhee"},{"family":"Ha","given":"Yujeong"},{"family":"Kwon","given":"Tae Woo"},{"family":"Jo","given":"Hyo-Sung"},{"family":"Moon","given":"Sang-Kwan"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yoonsung"},{"family":"Nah","given":"Seung-Yeol"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Min Soo"},{"family":"Cho","given":"Ik-Hyun"}],"citation-key":"ohNonsaponinPanaxGinseng2025","container-title":"Journal of Ginseng Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Ginseng Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jgr.2024.09.005","ISSN":"12268453","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1]]},"language":"en","page":"53-63","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Non-saponin from Panax ginseng maintains blood-brain barrier integrity by inhibiting NF-κB and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways to prevent the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1226845324001362","volume":"49"},{"id":"ohSerumNeurofilamentLight2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Oh","given":"Unsong"},{"family":"Woolbright","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Lehner-Gulotta","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Coleman","given":"Rachael"},{"family":"Conaway","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Goldman","given":"Myla D."},{"family":"Brenton","given":"J.

Chronic and overactive inflammation due to an effector T-cell-mediated aberrant immune response ultimately leads to tissue damage and neuronal cell death. To counteract peripheral and neuroinflammatory responses, research is being focused on regulatory T cell enhancement as a therapeutic target. Regulatory T cells are an immunosuppressive subpopulation of CD4+ T helper cells essential for maintaining immune homeostasis. The cells play pivotal roles in suppressing immune responses to maintain immune tolerance. In so doing, they control T cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production curtailing autoimmunity and inflammation. For nervous system pathologies, Treg are known to affect the onset and tempo of neural injuries. To this end, we review recent findings supporting Treg’s role in disease, as well as serving as a therapeutic agent in multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Guillain–Barre syndrome, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. An ever-broader role for Treg in the control of neurologic disease has been shown for traumatic brain injury, stroke, neurotrophic pain, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. To such ends, this review serves to examine the role played by Tregs in nervous system diseases with a focus on harnessing their functional therapeutic role(s).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Olson","given":"Katherine E"},{"family":"Mosley","given":"R L"},{"family":"Gendelman","given":"Howard E"}],"citation-key":"olsonPotentialTregenhancingTherapies2023","container-title":"Clinical and Experimental Immunology","DOI":"10.1093/cei/uxac084","ISSN":"0009-9104, 1365-2249","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,16]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/pages/standard-publication-reuse-rights","page":"108-121","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The potential for treg-enhancing therapies in nervous system pathologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/211/2/108/6679358","volume":"211"},{"id":"olssonCirculatingLevelsTight2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Olsson","given":"A."},{"family":"Gustavsen","given":"S."},{"family":"Langkilde","given":"A.R."},{"family":"Hansen","given":"T.H."},{"family":"Sellebjerg","given":"F."},{"family":"Bach Søndergaard","given":"H."},{"family":"Oturai","given":"A.B."}],"citation-key":"olssonCirculatingLevelsTight2021","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2021.103136","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"en","page":"103136","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Circulating levels of tight junction proteins in multiple sclerosis: Association with inflammation and disease activity before and after disease modifying therapy","title-short":"Circulating levels of tight junction proteins in multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S221103482100403X","volume":"54"},{"id":"oltarzhevskyiMeasurementEvaluationMethods2024","abstract":"Purpose This study aims to conceptualize, rethink and systematize methods used for measurement and evaluation (M&E) corporate communication. Design/methodology/approach The reflection is based on 462 key English-language books and papers devoted to M&E in the fields of corporate communication and public relations from the 1970th to 2023. Keywords in the titles and abstracts found the necessary materials. A critical analysis of the central concepts, models and methods described in the literature was conducted. As a result, a new model that unifies and structures the M&E toolkit is proposed for discussion. Findings Despite the significant contribution to developing a wide range of M&E models, they are still not perfect and universal. In addition, this system of approaches is continuously self-evolving and changing under the influence of digital innovations, so it requires steady rethinking and updating. On the other hand, most previous studies focused on communication management processes, losing focus on communication aspects. This led to the need for an alternative view based on proven theories to fill this gap. The proposed model combines quantitative and qualitative M&E methods for the five main components of corporate communication (communicator, audience, content, channels and result), covering a wide range of tools, from statistical and sociological research to big data analysis and neuro research. Originality/value This work contributes to developing the M&E theory of corporate communication, systematizing existing methods and opening new research perspectives. From a practical point of view, companies can use the presented approach for a more accurate and objective internal evaluation of the main components of corporate communication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Oltarzhevskyi","given":"Dmytro"}],"citation-key":"oltarzhevskyiMeasurementEvaluationMethods2024","container-title":"Corporate Communications: An International Journal","DOI":"10.1108/CCIJ-02-2024-0022","ISSN":"1356-3289","issue":"ahead-of-print","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Measurement and evaluation methods in corporate communications through the prism of Lasswell’s model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/CCIJ-02-2024-0022","volume":"ahead-of-print"},{"id":"openaiGPT4","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"OpenAi","given":""}],"citation-key":"openaiGPT4","language":"en-US","title":"GPT-4","type":"webpage","URL":"https://openai.com/gpt-4"},{"id":"openaiIntroducingChatGPT2022","abstract":"We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way.

Individuals with MS frequently present symptoms such as functional disability, obesity, and anxiety and depression. Axonal demyelination can be observed and implies alterations in mitochondrial activity and increased inflammation associated with disruptions in glutamate neurotransmitter activity. In this context, the ketogenic diet (KD), which promotes the production of ketone bodies in the blood [mainly β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB)], is a non-pharmacological therapeutic alternative that has shown promising results in peripheral obesity reduction and central inflammation reduction.

Current management strategies suppress or modulate immune function, all with consequences and known side effects. They demonstrate a high level of success in limiting new relapses. However, the neurodegenerative process still affects both grey and white matter in the central nervous system. The sigma1 (S1R) ligand-regulated chaperone is implicated in many biological processes in various CNS-targeted diseases, acting on neural plasticity, myelination and neuroinflammation. Among the proteins involved in MS, S1R has therefore emerged as a promising new target. Standard and robust methods have been adopted to analyze the adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) properties, safety pharmacology and toxicology of a previously synthetized simple benzamide-derived compound with nanomolar affinity for S1R, high selectivity, no cytotoxicity and good metabolic stability. The compound was also characterized as an agonist based on well-validated assays prior to in vivo investigations. Interestingly, we found that the oral administration of this compound resulted in an overall significant reduction in clinical progression in an MS experimental model. This effect is mediated through S1R action. Our results further suggest the potential use of this compound in the treatment of MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Oxombre","given":"Bénédicte"},{"family":"Madouri","given":"Fahima"},{"family":"Journé","given":"Anne-Sophie"},{"family":"Ravez","given":"Séverine"},{"family":"Woitrain","given":"Eloise"},{"family":"Odou","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Duhal","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Ninni","given":"Sandro"},{"family":"Montaigne","given":"David"},{"family":"Delhem","given":"Nadira"},{"family":"Vermersch","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Melnyk","given":"Patricia"}],"citation-key":"oxombreSafeEfficientSigma12022","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms231911893","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,6]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"11893","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Safe and Efficient Sigma1 Ligand: A Potential Drug Candidate for Multiple Sclerosis","title-short":"Safe and Efficient Sigma1 Ligand","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/19/11893","volume":"23"},{"id":"ozsoy-unubolEffectsRobotAssistedGait2022","abstract":"Objective\n              This study aims to evaluate and compare the effects of conventional and robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) programs on fatigue, mood, and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis who have fatigue.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                In this single-blinded, randomized controlled study, 37 patients with multiple sclerosis were randomized into two groups: RAGT (\n                n\n                = 18) and conventional gait training (\n                n\n                = 19).

Here, we explored the interplay between dietary intervention, proteomics profile, and accelerated brain age.Methods In the 18-month DIRECT PLUS trial, 294 participants (adherence rate=89%) were randomized to one of three arms: 1) Healthy dietary guidelines (HDG); 2) MED diet; or 3) green-MED diet. Both MED diets included 28g/day of walnuts. Additionally, the low red/processed meat green-MED group received daily supplements of polyphenol-rich green-tea and green Mankai aquatic plant. In this secondary analysis, we measured 87 serum proteins (Olink-CVDII) and conducted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to obtain brain 3D-T1-weighted for brain age calculation based on brain convolutional neural network to identify protein markers reflecting the brain age gap (BAG: residual deviation of MRI-assessed brain age from chronological age).Results We analyzed eligible brain MRIs (216 at baseline and 18-month) for BAG calculation. At baseline (age=51.3yrs, 90% men), lower weight, waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, and HbA1c parameters were associated with younger brain age than expected (p&lt;0.05 for all). At baseline, higher levels of two specific proteins: Galectin-9 (Gal-9) and Decorin (DCN), were associated with larger BAG (accelerated brain aging; FDR&lt;0.05). A proteomics principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a significant difference between the 18-month time points among participants who completed the trial with accelerated brain aging (p=0.02). Between baseline and 18 months, Gal-9 significantly decreased (p&lt;0.05) among individuals who completed the intervention with attenuated brain age, and DCN significantly increased (p&lt;0.05) among those who completed the trial with accelerated brain age. A significant interaction was observed between the green-MED diet and proteomics PCA change compared to the HDG (β=-1.7; p-interaction=0.05). Participants in the green-MED diet significantly decreased Gal-9 compared to the HDG diet (p=0.015) and from baseline (p=0.003). DCN levels, however, marginally increased in the HDG diet from baseline (p=0.053).Conclusion Higher serum levels of Gal-9 and DCN may indicate an acceleration of brain aging and might be reduced by the green-MED/high-polyphenol diet rich in Mankai and green-tea and low in red/processed meat.Trial registration number NCT03020186.Competing Interest StatementMB received honoraria for lectures and consultancy from Amgen, Astra Zeneca, Bayer, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Lilly, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi.

Thus, therapies to promote or accelerate myelination could potentially ameliorate symptoms in autism. Clemastine, a histamine H1 antagonist with anticholinergic properties against muscarinic M1 receptor, is the most promising drug with promyelinating properties. Clemastine penetrates the blood brain barrier efficiently and promotes remyelination in different animal models of neurodegeneration including multiple sclerosis, ischemia and Alzheimer’s disease. However, its role in myelination during development is unknown. We showed that clemastine treatment during development increased oligodendrocyte differentiation in both white and gray matter. However, despite the increase in the number of oligodendrocytes, conduction velocity of myelinated fibers of\n              corpus callosum\n              decreased in clemastine treated mice. Confocal and electron microscopy showed a reduction in the number of myelinated axons and nodes of Ranvier and a reduction of myelin thickness in\n              corpus callosum\n              . To understand the mechanisms leading to myelin formation impairment in the presence of an excess of myelinating oligodendrocytes, we focused on microglial cells that also express muscarinic M1 receptors. Importantly, the population of CD11c\n              +\n              microglia cells, necessary for myelination, as well as the levels of insulin growth factor-1 decrease in clemastine-treated mice. Altogether, these data suggest that clemastine impact on myelin development is more complex than previously thought and could be dependent on microglia-oligodendrocyte crosstalk. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of microglia cells on developmental myelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Palma","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Chara","given":"Juan Carlos"},{"family":"Montilla","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Otxoa-de-Amezaga","given":"Amaia"},{"family":"Ruíz-Jaén","given":"Francisca"},{"family":"Planas","given":"Anna M."},{"family":"Matute","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Pérez-Samartín","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Domercq","given":"María"}],"citation-key":"palmaClemastineInducesImpairment2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology","container-title-short":"Front.

A total of 129 participants (ages 65-90) completed the Horne &amp; Ostberg Morning-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and the Circadian Type Inventory (CTI) to assess their morning-evening preference and circadian traits, including rigidity, vigor, languidness, and flexibility. These subjective measures were compared to objective actigraphy data from a sub-cohort of 70 individuals who wore actigraphy watches for 24 hours a day over a 7-day period. Rest-activity rhythm variables were derived from the actigraphy data and analyzed. The results revealed sex differences in circadian behavior. Languid and flexible men (higher CTI scores) had significantly higher depression scores (GDS, p = 0.045) and showed more evening preference (MEQ, p = 0.007) compared to their vigorous and rigid counterparts, while no significant differences were found in women. Actigraphy data showed that men had less stable (interdaily stability, IS, p = 0.030) and more fragmented (interdaily variability, IV, p = 0.001) circadian rhythms than women. A significant association was found between acrophase time and CTI-FR scores (β = −0.406, p &lt; 0.001), with earlier acrophase times linked to more rigid circadian rhythms. Additionally, earlier acrophase times and morningness preference were associated with faster information processing speeds (IPS, p = 0.018). These findings suggest that circadian behaviors and their impact on mood and cognition are more pronounced in older men than women, highlighting the value of actigraphy in assessing circadian profiles and sex differences in aging.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Hillblom Foundation, the Rainwater Charitable Foundation, and the NIA: K08AG058749, R01AG060477, R01AG064314, K24AG053435, K23AG031861, K23AG038357, R01AG027859, P01AG1972403, P30AG062422.

Oligodendrocytes and myelin are essential for the function of the central nervous system, as evidenced by the severe neurological symptoms that arise in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophy. Although many cell-intrinsic mechanisms that regulate oligodendrocyte development and myelination have been reported, it remains unclear whether interactions among oligodendrocyte-lineage cells (OPCs and oligodendrocytes) affect oligodendrocyte development and myelination. Here, we show that blocking vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) 1/2/3-dependent exocytosis from oligodendrocyte-lineage cells impairs oligodendrocyte development, myelination, and motor behavior in mice. Adding oligodendrocyte-lineage cell-secreted molecules to secretion-deficient OPC cultures partially restores the morphological maturation of oligodendrocytes. Moreover, we identified L-type prostaglandin D synthase as an oligodendrocyte-lineage cell-secreted protein that promotes oligodendrocyte development and myelination in vivo. These findings reveal a novel autocrine/paracrine loop model for the regulation of oligodendrocyte and myelin development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pan","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Trimarco","given":"Amelia"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Alice J"},{"family":"Fujimori","given":"Ko"},{"family":"Urade","given":"Yoshihiro"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Lu O"},{"family":"Taveggia","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ye"}],"citation-key":"panOligodendrocytelineageCellExocytosis2023","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.77441","ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,13]]},"language":"en","page":"e77441","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Oligodendrocyte-lineage cell exocytosis and L-type prostaglandin D synthase promote oligodendrocyte development and myelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/77441","volume":"12"},{"id":"panouMyelinContentChanges2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Panou","given":"Τheodora"},{"family":"Kavroulakis","given":"Eleftherios"},{"family":"Mastorodemos","given":"Vasileios"},{"family":"Pouli","given":"Styliani"},{"family":"Kalaitzakis","given":"Georgios"},{"family":"Spyridaki","given":"Eirini"},{"family":"Maris","given":"Thomas G"},{"family":"Simos","given":"Panagiotis"},{"family":"Papadaki","given":"Efrosini"}],"citation-key":"panouMyelinContentChanges2021","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2021.103108","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"en","page":"103108","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Myelin content changes in Clinically Isolated Syndrome and Relapsing- Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: Associations with lesion type and severity of visuomotor impairment","title-short":"Myelin content changes in Clinically Isolated Syndrome and Relapsing- Remitting Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034821003758","volume":"54"},{"id":"pantEndophyticFungiPotential2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pant","given":"Anushree"},{"family":"Vasundhara","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"pantEndophyticFungiPotential2023","container-title":"Brazilian Journal of Microbiology","container-title-short":"Braz J Microbiol","DOI":"10.1007/s42770-023-00997-1","ISSN":"1517-8382, 1678-4405","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1479-1499","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Endophytic fungi: a potential source for drugs against central nervous system disorders","title-short":"Endophytic fungi","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s42770-023-00997-1","volume":"54"},{"id":"parameswaranActivatingCannabinoidReceptor2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Parameswaran","given":"Janani"},{"family":"Goicoechea","given":"Leire"},{"family":"Planas-Serra","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Pastor","given":"Antoni"},{"family":"Ruiz","given":"Montserrat"},{"family":"Calingasan","given":"Noel Y."},{"family":"Guilera","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Aso","given":"Ester"},{"family":"Boada","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Pamplona","given":"Reinald"},{"family":"Portero-Otín","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"De La Torre","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Ferrer","given":"Isidre"},{"family":"Casasnovas","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Pujol","given":"Aurora"},{"family":"Fourcade","given":"Stéphane"}],"citation-key":"parameswaranActivatingCannabinoidReceptor2022","container-title":"Acta Neuropathologica","container-title-short":"Acta Neuropathol","DOI":"10.1007/s00401-022-02451-2","ISSN":"0001-6322, 1432-0533","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"en","page":"241-258","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Activating cannabinoid receptor 2 preserves axonal health through GSK-3β/NRF2 axis in adrenoleukodystrophy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00401-022-02451-2","volume":"144"},{"id":"parandavarLongtermDemyelinationAgingassociated2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disorder affecting the central nervous system. Evidence suggests that age‐related neurodegeneration contributes to disability progression during the chronic stages of MS. Aging is characterized by decreased regeneration potential and impaired myelin repair in the brain. It is hypothesized that accelerated cellular aging contributes to the functional decline associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We assessed the impact of aging on myelin content in the corpus callosum (CC) and compared aging with the long‐term demyelination (LTD) consequents induced by 12 weeks of feeding with a cuprizone (CPZ) diet. Initially, evaluating myelin content in 2‐, 6‐, and 18‐month‐old mice revealed a reduction in myelin content, particularly at 18 months. Myelin thickness was decreased and the g‐ratio increased in aged mice. Although a lower myelin content and higher g‐ratio were observed in LTD model mice, compared to the normally aged mice, both aging and LTD exhibited relatively similar myelin ultrastructure. Our findings provide evidence that LTD exhibits the hallmarks of aging such as elevated expression of senescence‐associated genes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and high level of oxidative stress as observed following normal aging.

We calculated data-driven spatial patterns of similar WMHs, revealing distinct periventricular, posterior, and anterior clusters. We identified a reproducible WMH signature linked to dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, characterized by a posterior predominance and a pathophysiological pattern indicative of selective fiber degeneration. Posterior WMHs connected cortical regions vulnerable to tau pathology.

Intermuscular coordination of the stroke survivors and the control participants was quantified in the form of muscle synergies.

When the number of muscle synergies between the groups matched, the comparable composition of muscle synergies was observed in both groups.

Although the exact pathogenesis remains unknown, the leading theory is that it results from immune system dysregulation. Approved disease-modifying therapy appears to modulate the immune system to improve MS-related outcomes. There is substantial interest in the ability of dietary interventions to influence MS-related outcomes. This is an update of the Cochrane Review 'Dietary interventions for multiple sclerosis' (Farinotti 2003; Farinotti 2007; Farinotti 2012). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of dietary interventions (including dietary plans with recommendations for specific whole foods, macronutrients, and natural health products) compared to placebo or another intervention on health outcomes (including MS-related outcomes and serious adverse events) in people with MS. SEARCH METHODS: On 30 May 2019, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD). We checked reference lists in identified trials and requested information from trial authors to identify any additional published or unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included any randomized controlled trial (RCT) or controlled clinical trial (CCT) examining the effect of a dietary intervention versus placebo or another intervention among participants with MS on MS-related outcomes, including relapses, disability progression, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Planned primary outcomes were number of participants experiencing relapse and change in disability progression, according to a validated disability scale at the last reported follow-up. Secondary outcomes included MRI activity, safety, and patient-reported outcomes. We entered and analysed data in Review Manager 5. MAIN RESULTS: We found 41 full-text articles examining 30 trials following full-text review. Participants were adults with MS, defined by established criteria, presenting to MS clinics in Europe, North America, and the Middle East. Study design varied considerably, although all trials had at least one methodological issue leading to unknown or high risk of bias. Trials examined: supplementation to increase polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (11 trials); a variety of antioxidant supplements (10 trials); dietary programmes (3 trials); and other dietary supplements (e.g. acetyl L-carnitine, biotin, creatine, palmitoylethanolamide, probiotic, riboflavin) (6 trials). In three trials comparing PUFAs with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), the evidence was very uncertain concerning difference in relapses (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.20; 3 studies, 217 participants; 75% in the PUFA group versus 74% in the MUFA group; very low-certainty evidence). Among four trials comparing PUFAs with MUFAs, there may be little to no difference in global impression of deterioration (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.03; 4 studies, 542 participants; 40% in the PUFA group versus 47% in the MUFA group; low-certainty evidence). In two trials comparing PUFAs with MUFAs (102 participants), there was very low-certainty evidence for change in disability progression. None of the PUFA versus MUFA trials examined MRI outcomes. In one trial comparing PUFAs with MUFAs (40 participants), there were no serious adverse events; based on low-certainty evidence. In two trials comparing different PUFAs (omega-3 versus omega-6), there may be little to no difference in relapses (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.66; 2 studies, 129 participants; 30% in the omega-3 versus 29% in the omega-6 group; low-certainty evidence). Among three trials comparing omega-3 with omega-6, there may be little to no difference in change in disability progression, measured as mean change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.30; 3 studies, 166 participants; low-certainty evidence). In one trial comparing omega-3 with omega-6, there was likely no difference in global impression of deterioration (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.91; 1 study, 86 participants; 29% in omega-3 versus 29% in omega-6 group; moderate-certainty evidence). In one trial comparing omega-3 with omega-6 (86 participants), there was likely no difference in number of new T1- weighted gadolinium-enhancing lesions, based on moderate-certainty evidence. In four trials comparing omega-3 with omega-6, there may be little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.31; 4 studies, 230 participants; 6% in omega-3 versus 5% in omega-6 group; low-certainty evidence). In four trials examining antioxidant supplementation with placebo, there may be little to no difference in relapses (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.64; 4 studies, 345 participants; 17% in the antioxidant group versus 17% in the placebo group; low-certainty evidence). In six trials examining antioxidant supplementation with placebo, the evidence was very uncertain concerning change in disability progression, measured as mean change of EDSS (MD -0.19, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.11; 6 studies, 490 participants; very low-certainty evidence). In two trials examining antioxidant supplementation with placebo, there may be little to no difference in global impression of deterioration (RR 0.99, 95% 0.50 to 1.93; 2 studies, 190 participants; 15% in the antioxidant group versus 15% in the placebo group; low-certainty evidence). In two trials examining antioxidant supplementation with placebo, the evidence was very uncertain concerning difference in gadolinium-enhancing lesions (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.09 to 4.88; 2 studies, 131 participants; 11% in the antioxidant group versus 16% in the placebo group; very low-certainty evidence). In three trials examining antioxidant supplementation versus placebo, there may be little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR. 0.72, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.08; 3 studies, 222 participants; 3% in the antioxidant group versus 4% in the placebo group; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are a variety of controlled trials addressing the effects of dietary interventions for MS with substantial variation in active treatment, comparator, and outcomes of interest. PUFA administration may not differ when compared to alternatives with regards to relapse rate, disability worsening, or overall clinical status in people with MS, but evidence is uncertain. Similarly, at present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether supplementation with antioxidants or other dietary interventions have any impact on MS-related outcomes.","author":[{"literal":"Parks N E"},{"literal":"Jackson-Tarlton C S"},{"literal":"Vacchi L"},{"literal":"Merdad R"},{"literal":"Johnston B C"}],"citation-key":"parksneDietaryInterventionsMultiple2020","container-title":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD004192.pub4","ISSN":"1361-6137","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"Cd004192","title":"Dietary interventions for multiple sclerosis-related outcomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004192.pub4","volume":"5"},{"id":"parkSphingosylphosphorylcholineInhibitsPlasma2023","abstract":"Introduction\n              Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease that damages the brain and spinal cord, inducing paralysis of the body.

The mechanism is hypothesized to involve unregulated peripheral inflammation resulting in blood–brain barrier damage, and eventual axonal damage and demyelination. Based on this understanding, the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), often is utilized to study lymphocyte activation. Therapeutic paradigms of exogenous opioid growth factor (OGF) or low‐dose naltrexone (LDN) treatment can modulate EAE, but little is reported regarding OGF or LDN effects on peripheral inflammation, microglia activation, and/or macrophage proliferation. Moreover, little is known about differential responses to LDN or OGF relative to the duration and timing of treatment. Utilizing a female mouse model of EAE, two treatment regimens were established to investigate differences between prophylactic treatment and traditional therapy initiated at the time of disease presentation. Prophylactic OGF or LDN treatment delayed the onset of behavior, suppressed neutrophil replication, and curtailed lymphocyte proliferation which ultimately improved behavioral outcome. Traditional therapy with OGF or LDN reversed behavioral deficits, restored OGF and IL‐17 serum levels, and inhibited microglial activation within 8 days. Reduced serum OGF levels in untreated EAE mice correlated with increased microglia activation within lumbar spinal cords. Both treatment regimens of OGF or LDN reduced activated microglia, whereas only prophylactic treatment prevented CNS macrophage aggregation. These data demonstrate that the timing of LDN or OGF treatment initiation alters outcomes and can prevent or reverse behavioral deficits, cytokine activation, and spinal cord pathology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Patel","given":"Chirag"},{"family":"Zagon","given":"Ian S."},{"family":"Pearce‐Clawson","given":"Mason"},{"family":"McLaughlin","given":"Patricia J."}],"citation-key":"patelTimingTreatmentEndogenous2022","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience Research","container-title-short":"J of Neuroscience Research","DOI":"10.1002/jnr.24983","ISSN":"0360-4012, 1097-4547","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2]]},"language":"en","page":"551-563","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Timing of treatment with an endogenous opioid alters immune response and spinal cord pathology in female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24983","volume":"100"},{"id":"patergnaniAntipsychoticDrugsCounteract2021","abstract":"Significance\n            Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease in young adults. Advances in the understanding of the cellular mechanisms that contribute to MS may help to develop new therapies. Here, we elucidated the role of autophagy (a controlled intracellular pathway regulating the degradation of cellular components) and mitophagy (a specific form of autophagy that removes dysfunctional mitochondria) in MS. We found that human and experimental MS induces a mitochondrial deficit that leads to activation of autophagy and mitophagy. These phenomena play a causal role in MS because their inhibition with antipsychotic drugs prevents demyelination, induces remyelination, and reverts MS behavioral deficits. Our data suggest the repurposing of these Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs for the treatment of MS.\n          , \n            Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease characterized by myelin damage followed by axonal and ultimately neuronal loss. The etiology and physiopathology of MS are still elusive, and no fully effective therapy is yet available. We investigated the role in MS of autophagy (physiologically, a controlled intracellular pathway regulating the degradation of cellular components) and of mitophagy (a specific form of autophagy that removes dysfunctional mitochondria). We found that the levels of autophagy and mitophagy markers are significantly increased in the biofluids of MS patients during the active phase of the disease, indicating activation of these processes. In keeping with this idea, in vitro and in vivo MS models (induced by proinflammatory cytokines, lysolecithin, and cuprizone) are associated with strongly impaired mitochondrial activity, inducing a lactic acid metabolism and prompting an increase in the autophagic flux and in mitophagy. Multiple structurally and mechanistically unrelated inhibitors of autophagy improved myelin production and normalized axonal myelination, and two such inhibitors, the widely used antipsychotic drugs haloperidol and clozapine, also significantly improved cuprizone-induced motor impairment. These data suggest that autophagy has a causal role in MS; its inhibition strongly attenuates behavioral signs in an experimental model of the disease. Therefore, haloperidol and clozapine may represent additional therapeutic tools against MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Patergnani","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Bonora","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Ingusci","given":"Selene"},{"family":"Previati","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Marchi","given":"Saverio"},{"family":"Zucchini","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Perrone","given":"Mariasole"},{"family":"Wieckowski","given":"Mariusz R."},{"family":"Castellazzi","given":"Massimiliano"},{"family":"Pugliatti","given":"Maura"},{"family":"Giorgi","given":"Carlotta"},{"family":"Simonato","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Pinton","given":"Paolo"}],"citation-key":"patergnaniAntipsychoticDrugsCounteract2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) has been identified as a potential target for the development of remyelinating therapies; however, prototypical KOR agonists, such as U50,488 have side effects, which limit clinical use. In the current study, we investigated a Salvinorin A analog, ethoxymethyl ether Salvinorin B (EOM SalB) in two preclinical models of demyelination in C57BL/6J mice. We showed that in cellular assays EOM SalB was G-protein biased, an effect often correlated with fewer KOR-mediated side effects. In the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, we found that EOM SalB (0.1–0.3 mg/kg) effectively decreased disease severity in a KOR-dependent manner and led to a greater number of animals in recovery compared to U50,488 treatment. Furthermore, EOM SalB treatment decreased immune cell infiltration and increased myelin levels in the central nervous system. In the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, we showed that EOM SalB (0.3 mg/kg) administration led to an increase in the number of mature oligodendrocytes, the number of myelinated axons and the myelin thickness in the corpus callosum. Overall, EOM SalB was effective in two preclinical models of multiple sclerosis and demyelination, adding further evidence to show KOR agonists are a promising target for remyelinating therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Paton","given":"Kelly F."},{"family":"Robichon","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Templeton","given":"Nikki"},{"family":"Denny","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Al Abadey","given":"Afnan"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Prisinzano","given":"Thomas E."},{"family":"La Flamme","given":"Anne C."},{"family":"Kivell","given":"Bronwyn M."}],"citation-key":"patonSalvinorinAnalogueEthoxymethyl2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Neurology","container-title-short":"Front.

It has been hypothesized that such dysregulation, including alterations of the glutathione (GSH) cycle could participate in the brain white matter (WM) abnormalities in SZ due to the oligodendrocytes’ susceptibility to oxidative stress (OxS).In this study we aim to assess the differences between 82 schizophrenia patients (PT) and 86 healthy controls (HC) in GSH-redox peripheral blood markers: GSH peroxidase (GPx), reductase (GR) enzymatic activities and their ratio (GPx/GR-ratio), evaluating the hypotheses that alterations in the homeostasis of the systemic GSH cycle may be associated with pathological mechanisms in the brain WM in PT. To do so, we employ the advanced diffusion MRI methods: Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) and White Matter Tract Integrity-Watson (WMTI-W), which provide excellent sensitivity to demyelination and neuroinflammation.We show that GPx levels are higher (p=0.00071) in female participants (HC and PT combined) and decrease with aging (p=0.026). We find differences between PT and HC in the association of GR and mean kurtosis (MK, p&lt;0.0001). Namely, lower MK was associated with higher blood GR activity in HC, but not in PT, suggesting that high GR activity (a hallmark of reductive stress) in HC was linked to changes in myelin integrity. However, GSH-redox peripheral blood markers did not explain the WM anomalies detected in PT, or the design of the present study could not detect subtle phenomenon, if present.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (PCEFP2_194260, to I.J.; 320030_197787 to PH and YA), the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) \"SYNAPSY - The Synaptic Bases of Mental Diseases\" from the Swiss National Science Foundation (51NF40_185897 to KQD &amp; PC) and the Foundation Alamaya.

Through its two receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2, soluble versus membrane-bound TNF enable cell death or survival in a variety of cell types. TNF-TNFRs signaling orchestrates important biological functions such as inflammation, neuronal activity as well as tissue de- and regeneration. TNF-TNFRs signaling is a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but animal and clinical studies yielded conflicting findings. Here, we ask whether a sequential modulation of TNFR1 and TNFR2 signaling is beneficial in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental mouse model that recapitulates inflammatory and demyelinating aspects of MS. To this end, human TNFR1 antagonist and TNFR2 agonist were administered peripherally at different stages of disease development in TNFR-humanized mice. We found that stimulating TNFR2 before onset of symptoms leads to improved response to anti-TNFR1 therapeutic treatment. This sequential treatment was more effective in decreasing paralysis symptoms and demyelination, when compared to single treatments. Interestingly, the frequency of the different immune cell subsets is unaffected by TNFR modulation. Nevertheless, treatment with only a TNFR1 antagonist increases T-cell infiltration in the central nervous system (CNS) and B-cell cuffing at the perivascular sites, whereas a TNFR2 agonist promotes Treg CNS accumulation. Our findings highlight the complicated nature of TNF signaling which requires a timely balance of selective activation and inhibition of TNFRs in order to exert therapeutic effects in the context of CNS autoimmunity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pegoretti","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Roman"},{"family":"Paro","given":"Iskra"},{"family":"Douwenga","given":"Wanda"},{"family":"Kontermann","given":"Roland E."},{"family":"Pfizenmaier","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Houben","given":"Evelien"},{"family":"Broux","given":"Bieke"},{"family":"Hellings","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Baron","given":"Wia"},{"family":"Laman","given":"Jon D."},{"family":"Eisel","given":"Ulrich L.

The treatment with TMS and NTZ had a beneficial effect on muscle involvement in the EAE model. There was a clinical improvement in functional motor deficits, atrophy was attenuated, neurogenic muscle lesions were reduced, and the level of oxidative stress biomarkers was lower in both treatment groups. Compared to NTZ, the best response was obtained with TMS for all the parameters analyzed. The myoprotective effect of TMS was higher than that of NTZ.

Preclinical studies have highlighted the benefit of UCB for a broad range of conditions including haematological conditions, metabolic disorders and neurological conditions, however clinical translation of UCB therapies is lacking. One barrier for clinical translation is inadequate cell numbers in some samples meaning that often a therapeutic dose cannot be achieved. This is particularly important when treating adults or when administering repeat doses of cells. To overcome this, UCB cell expansion is being explored to increase cell numbers. The current focus of UCB cell expansion is CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for which the main application is treatment of haematological conditions. Currently there are 36 registered clinical trials that are examining the efficacy of expanded UCB cells with 31 of these being for haematological malignancies. Early data from these trials suggest that expanded UCB cells are a safe and feasible treatment option and show greater engraftment potential than unexpanded UCB. Outside of the haematology research space, expanded UCB has been trialled as a therapy in only two preclinical studies, one for spinal cord injury and one for hind limb ischemia. Proteomic analysis of expanded UCB cells in these studies showed that the cells were neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and angiogenic. These findings are also supported by in vitro studies where expanded UCB CD34+ cells showed increased gene expression of neurotrophic and angiogenic factors compared to unexpanded CD34+ cells. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that unexpanded CD34+ cells are a promising therapy for neurological conditions where they have been shown to improve multiple indices of injury in rodent models of stroke, Parkinson’s disease and neonatal hypoxic ischemic brain injury. This review will highlight the current application of expanded UCB derived HSCs in transplant medicine, and also explore the potential use of expanded HSCs as a therapy for neurological conditions. It is proposed that expanded UCB derived CD34+ cells are an appropriate cellular therapy for a range of neurological conditions in children and adults.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Penny","given":"Tayla R."},{"family":"Jenkin","given":"Graham"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Suzanne L."},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Courtney A."}],"citation-key":"pennyUmbilicalCordBlood2024","container-title":"Stem Cell Research & Therapy","container-title-short":"Stem Cell Res Ther","DOI":"10.1186/s13287-024-03830-0","ISSN":"1757-6512","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,29]]},"language":"en","page":"234","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Umbilical cord blood derived cell expansion: a potential neuroprotective therapy","title-short":"Umbilical cord blood derived cell expansion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-024-03830-0","volume":"15"},{"id":"pernetNogoAAntibodyDelivery2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            Systemic administration of Nogo-A-neutralizing antibody ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle limiting the passage of systemically applied antibody to the CNS. To bypass the BBB, in the present study we tested the intranasal route of administration by targeting the olfactory mucosa with the Nogo-A-blocking antibody 11C7 mAb in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced EAE. Antibodies were specifically administered onto the olfactory mucosa using a microcatheter. Antibody distribution was examined in the CNS by ELISA and light-sheet microscopy. The effects of 11C7 mAb on Nogo-A signaling were assessed by Western blotting. EAE-induced deficits were monitored daily. Demyelination was observed on spinal cord histological sections. Gene expression changes were followed by trancriptomic analyses. A sensitive capture ELISA revealed a rapid and widespread distribution of 11C7 mAb in the CNS, including the olfactory bulb, the cerebellum and the lumbar spinal cord, but not in the CSF. Light-sheet microscopy allowed to observe antibody accumulation in the parenchyma, thus demonstrating nose-to-brain transfer of IgG. At the functional level, the widespread penetration of 11C7 mAb in the CNS, including the thoracolumbar spinal cord, resulted in the improvement of motor symptoms and in the preservation of myelin in the spinal cord of EAE mice. This was accompanied by Nogo-A signaling downregulation, as reflected by the decreased level of phosphorylated cofilin observed by Western blotting in the cerebellum. In the brain of EAE score-matched animals, 11C7 modified the expression of genes that can influence neurotransmission and cognitive functions, independently of the demyelination phenotype in the spinal cord. In conclusion, our data show the feasibility of olfactory mucosa-directed administration for the delivery of therapeutic antibodies targeting CNS antigens in EAE mice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pernet","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Joly","given":"Sandrine"},{"family":"Spiegel","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Meli","given":"Ivo"},{"family":"Idriss","given":"Sherif"},{"family":"Maigler","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Mdzomba","given":"Julius Baya"},{"family":"Roenneke","given":"Anna K."},{"family":"Franceschini","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Silvestri","given":"Ludovico"},{"family":"Pavone","given":"Francesco S."},{"family":"Calamai","given":"Martino"},{"family":"Schindowski","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"pernetNogoAAntibodyDelivery2023","container-title":"Cell Death Discovery","container-title-short":"Cell Death Discov.","DOI":"10.1038/s41420-023-01588-7","ISSN":"2058-7716","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,9]]},"language":"en","page":"290","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Nogo-A antibody delivery through the olfactory mucosa mitigates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the mouse CNS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41420-023-01588-7","volume":"9"},{"id":"perussoloCellularTherapyExperimental2024","abstract":"This study aims to evaluate and compare cellular therapy with human Wharton’s jelly (WJ) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neural precursors (NPs) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a preclinical model of Multiple Sclerosis.

A defining characteristic of MS is the ability of autoreactive T lymphocytes to cross the blood–brain barrier and mediate inflammation within the CNS. Previous work from our lab found the gene\n              Enpp2\n              to be highly upregulated in murine encephalitogenic T cells.\n              Enpp2\n              encodes for the protein autotaxin, a secreted glycoprotein that catalyzes the production of lysophosphatidic acid and promotes transendothelial migration of T cells from the bloodstream into the lymphatic system. The present study sought to characterize autotaxin expression in T cells during CNS autoimmune disease and determine its potential therapeutic value. Myelin‐activated CD4 T cells upregulated expression of autotaxin in vitro, and ex vivo analysis of CNS‐infiltrating CD4 T cells showed significantly higher autotaxin expression compared with cells from healthy mice. In addition, inhibiting autotaxin in myelin‐specific T cells reduced their encephalitogenicity in adoptive transfer studies and decreased in vitro cell motility. Importantly, using two mouse models of MS, treatment with an autotaxin inhibitor ameliorated EAE severity, decreased the number of CNS infiltrating T and B cells, and suppressed relapses, suggesting autotaxin may be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Petersen‐Cherubini","given":"Cora L."},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Shawn P."},{"family":"Xin","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Deffenbaugh","given":"Joshua L."},{"family":"Jahan","given":"Ishrat"},{"family":"Rau","given":"Christina N."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yuhong"},{"family":"Lovett‐Racke","given":"Amy E."}],"citation-key":"petersen-cherubiniAutotaxinEncephalitogenicCD42024","container-title":"European Journal of Immunology","container-title-short":"Eur J Immunol","DOI":"10.1002/eji.202350561","ISSN":"0014-2980, 1521-4141","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","page":"2350561","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Autotaxin in encephalitogenic CD4 T cells as a therapeutic target for multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eji.202350561","volume":"54"},{"id":"petersenMappingAssociationCerebral2025","abstract":"INTRODUCTION Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. Understanding the brain structural changes associated with CSVD is vital to meet the related health care demands effectively. This study focuses on assessing the integrity of gray matter in relation to CSVD within the general population.METHODS &amp; RESULTS We examined 2,603 participants (mean age 65 years) from the Hamburg City Health Study, who underwent neuropsychological evaluations and multi-modal neuroimaging. Advanced imaging techniques were used to assess the microstructural and macrostructural integrity of cortical and subcortical gray matter, including the hippocampus. Our findings indicate that the extent of CSVD is associated with abnormalities in gray matter diffusivity, myelin content, and morphology in specific brain regions including the anterior cingulate, insular and temporal cortices, caudate, putamen, pallidum, and hippocampus. Crucially, CSVD-related gray matter abnormalities were linked to cross-domain cognitive performance, represented by the first principal component of multi-domain cognitive test scores.DISCUSSION Complementing previous research that focuses on CSVD and white matter changes, our study highlights abnormal gray matter integrity as a possible link between small vessel pathology and cognitive disorders. The insights gained can guide diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, supporting the advancement of interventions tailored to mitigate the impact of CSVD.Competing Interest StatementJF reported receiving personal fees from Acandis, Cerenovus, Microvention, Medtronic, Phenox, and Penumbra; receiving grants from Stryker and Route 92; being managing director of eppdata; and owning shares in Tegus and Vastrax; all outside the submitted work.

Fatigue is commonly reported by people with MS (PwMS). MS-related fatigue severely affects daily activities, employment, socioeconomic status, and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether psychological interventions are effective in managing fatigue in PwMS. DATA SOURCES: We performed systematic searches of Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published from database inception to April 5, 2017. Reference lists from relevant reviews were also searched. STUDY SELECTION AND DESIGN: Two independent reviewers screened the papers, extracted data, and appraised the included studies. A clinical psychologist verified whether interventions were psychological approaches. A narrative synthesis was conducted for all included studies. For relevant randomized controlled trials that reported sufficient information to determine standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Of the 353 identified articles, 20 studies with 1,249 PwMS were included in this systematic review. Narrative synthesis revealed that psychological interventions reduced fatigue in PwMS. Meta-analyses revealed that cognitive behavioral therapy decreased levels of fatigue compared with non-active controls (SMD = -0.32; 95% CI: -0.63 to -0.01) and compared with active controls (relaxation or psychotherapy) (SMD = -0.71; 95% CI: -1.05 to -0.37). Meta-analyses further showed that both relaxation (SMD = -0.90; 95% CI: -1.30 to -0.51), and mindfulness interventions (SMD = -0.62; 95% CI: -1.12 to -0.12), compared with non-active control, decreased fatigue levels. The estimates of heterogeneity for the four meta-analyses varied between none and moderate. CONCLUSION: This study found that the use of psychological interventions for MS-related fatigue management reduced fatigue in PwMS. While psychological interventions are generally considered first-line therapy for MS-related fatigue, further studies are needed to explore the long-term effect of this therapy.","author":[{"literal":"Phyo A Z.

Soliciting suggestions is a form of distant search, since it allows organizations to tap into knowledge that may not reside within their organizational boundaries. Organizations engaging in distant search often face a large pool of suggestions, an outcome we refer to as crowding. When crowding occurs, organizations, given a limited attention span, can attend to only a subset of suggestions. Our core argument is that crowding narrows the attention of organizations; that is, despite organizations’ efforts to reach out to external contributors and access suggestions that capture distant knowledge, they are more likely to pay attention to suggestions that are familiar, not distant. We test our theory with a unique longitudinal dataset that captures how 922 organizations responded to 105,127 crowdsourced suggestions from external contributors. After distinguishing between three different dimensions of distance (content, structural, and personal), we find that (a) all three types of distance have independent negative effects on the likelihood of attention, (b) crowding amplifies these negative effects, and (c) there are differences among the effects’ magnitudes. We elaborate on the broader implications of these findings for the literatures on attention, search, and crowdsourcing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Piezunka","given":"Henning"},{"family":"Dahlander","given":"Linus"}],"citation-key":"piezunkaDistantSearchNarrow2015","container-title":"Academy of Management Journal","container-title-short":"AMJ","DOI":"10.5465/amj.2012.0458","ISSN":"0001-4273","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6]]},"page":"856-880","publisher":"Academy of Management","source":"journals.aom.org (Atypon)","title":"Distant Search, Narrow Attention: How Crowding Alters Organizations’ Filtering of Suggestions in Crowdsourcing","title-short":"Distant Search, Narrow Attention","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2012.0458","volume":"58"},{"id":"pillerGlutamateSignalingAMPAR2021","abstract":"Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are specified from discrete precursor populations during gliogenesis and migrate extensively from their origins, ultimately distributing throughout the brain and spinal cord during early development. Subsequently, a subset of OPCs differentiates into mature oligodendrocytes, which myelinate axons. This process is necessary for efficient neuronal signaling and organism survival. Previous studies have identified several factors that influence OPC development, including excitatory glutamatergic synapses that form between neurons and OPCs during myelination. However, little is known about how glutamate signaling affects OPC migration before myelination. In this study, we use\n              in vivo,\n              time-lapse imaging in zebrafish in conjunction with genetic and pharmacological perturbation to investigate OPC migration and myelination when the GluR4A ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit is disrupted.

Genetic mosaic analysis confirmed that these effects were cell-autonomous, and we identified that voltage-gated calcium channels were downstream of glutamate receptor signaling in OPCs and could rescue the migration and myelination defects we observed when glutamate signaling was perturbed. These results offer new insights into the complex system of neuron-OPC interactions and reveal a cell-autonomous role for glutamatergic signaling in OPCs during neural development.\n            \n            \n              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT\n              The migration of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) is an essential process during development that leads to uniform oligodendrocyte distribution and sufficient myelination for central nervous system function.

We investigated quantitative T1 mapping (QT1) as a clinically feasible tool for measuring myelination in children with neurodevelopmental disorders of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway (RASopathies).Methods We collected QT1, diffusion-weighted, and structural MRI scans from 72 children (49 RASopathies, 23 typical developing (TD)). QT1 measures of myelin content included the macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) in white matter and R1 (1/T1 relaxation) of the cortex. For white matter, we assessed between-groups differences across 39 tracts. For cortical R1, we used principal components analysis to reduce dimensionality and capture myelination patterns across 360 regions. A multivariate ANOVA assessed differences across principal components. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) identified the most discriminative features between TD and RASopathies.Results Thirty-four of 39 tracts were higher in MTV in RASopathies relative to TD (pFDR&lt;.05), indicating widespread elevation in myelination. Our MANOVA revealed a group effect on cortical R1 (p=.002, η2=.028), suggesting cortical myelination differences between-groups. SVM yielded an accuracy of 87% and identified cognitive and cortical R1 features as the most discriminant between-groups.Conclusions We found widespread elevated myelin in white matter tracts and region-dependent patterns of cortical myelination in children with RASopathies. QT1 enabled us to leverage preclinical models showing oligodendrocyte dysfunction to uncover the myelination pattern in vivo in the developing human brain. Using QT1, myelin represents a promising treatment target that can be identified and monitored in neurodevelopmental disorders, offering significant potential for advancing current therapeutic strategies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project was supported by grants: Contract grant sponsor: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Contract grant number: 123752K23 and R01HD108684 to T.G; The Stephen Bechtel Endowed Faculty Scholar in Pediatric Translational Medicine, Stanford Maternal &amp; Child Health Research Institute to T.G.

Pharmacological treatment options for MS-related fatigue show only limited and contradicting results. Consequently, many pwMS search for alternative options to control the symptom. A considerable interest in dietary interventions as a means of MS symptom management has advanced in the MS community. Yet, the few empirical studies focussing on the effect of holistic dietary intake on fatigue have not been systematically examined. The aim of this review was to systematically review the effect of holistic dietary intake and the subjective perception of fatigue in adult pwMS. Methods: Embase, Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, SPORTDiscus, PsycInfo, and Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine (Ebsco Host) databases were systematically searched to locate relevant literature. Intervention trials studying the effect of a holistic dietary regimen on the subjective perception of fatigue in a sample of adult pwMS were considered for inclusion. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified Downs and Black checklist. Results: A total of four studies met the inclusion criteria: one single arm intervention pilot trial, one randomised controlled pilot trial, one double-blinded randomised trial, and one assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial. Interventions were low fat diets, a low fat, starchy plant food diet, and modified paleo diets and ranged from three to 12 months duration. Two studies supplying an adequate amount of folate and magnesium with the intervention diet reported relevant improvements in fatigue scores. Conclusion: Dietary intake holds the potential to lower MS-related fatigue, but solid conclusions are not possible based on the existing evidence. Sparse evidence points towards an effect of adequate magnesium and folate intake and a trend for decreased fatigue.","author":[{"literal":"Pommerich U M"},{"literal":"Brincks J"},{"literal":"Christensen M E"}],"citation-key":"pommerichumThereEffectDietary2018","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2018.08.017","ISSN":"2211-0356 2211-0348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"282-291","title":"Is there an effect of dietary intake on MS-related fatigue? – A systematic literature review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2018.08.017","volume":"25"},{"id":"poologaindranCellularConnectomicCognitive2025","abstract":"Awake surgery with intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES) is the gold-standard to maximize the extent of resection in diffuse cerebral gliomas (Duffau et al. 2023). While this approach is effective in testing for simple motor and language functions, it is inadequate for mapping higher-order cognitive functions such as attention, working memory, and cognitive control. Given that systems neuroscience is moving away from a localizationist to a connectomic perspective of human brain function, ideally, we could better understand how gliomas integrate within the connectome and how performing surgery on the brain’s mesoscale hub architecture affects long-term cognitive outcomes. To address problem, we combined cellular, connectomic, and cognitive data from healthy individuals (n=629) across the lifespan, cross-sectional glioma imaging (n=98), the Allan Human Brain Atlas (n=6), and a rare cohort of diffuse glioma patients (n=17) followed longitudinally as they underwent neurosurgery. First, we validate that meta-analytic cognitive activation maps co-localize with the Multiple Demand (MD) system and show that diffuse gliomas preferentially localize to the ‘core’ of this brain network. Second, cellular decoding of the MD core network reveals that it is uniquely enriched with oligodendrocyte precursor cells, glioma proto-oncogenes, and 5HT2-serotonergic neurotransmission. Third, the MD system is preferentially enriched for connector hubs to scaffolding the brain’s mesoscale hub architecture and that diffuse gliomas induce reorganization in this architecture thereby minimizing cognitive deficits. Lastly, surgical resection of connector, rather than provincial, hubs leads to long-term cognitive deficits while maintenance or dissolution of interhemispheric modularity predicted long-term cognitive outcomes. With the recent demonstration of the high concordance between DES and functional brain mapping (Saurrubo et al. 2024), this study provides new insight into how gliomas integrate within the connectome and that mapping the mesoscale hub architecture in each patient may improve presurgical mapping and postsurgical rehabilitation. Given the small but deeply sampled neurosurgical cohort, additional studies are now warranted to assess the value of mapping mesoscale connectivity for presurgical mapping and ‘interventional neurorehabilitation’ (Poologaindran et al. 2022).Competing Interest StatementMES is the co-founder of Omniscient NeurotechnologyFunding StatementThis research was supported by the Alan Turing Institute and NSERC grants.

While endogenous remyelination helps to recover function, this restorative process tends to become less efficient over time. Currently, intense efforts aimed at the mechanisms that promote remyelination are being considered promising therapeutic approaches. The M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1R) was previously identified as a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Here, we validate M1R as a target for remyelination by characterizing expression in human and rodent oligodendroglial cells (including those in human MS tissue) using a highly selective M1R probe. As a breakthrough to conventional methodology, we conjugated a fluorophore to a highly M1R selective peptide (MT7) which targets the M1R in the subnanomolar range. This allows for exceptional detection of M1R protein expression in the human CNS. More importantly, we introduce PIPE-307, a brain-penetrant, small-molecule antagonist with favorable drug-like properties that selectively targets M1R. We evaluate PIPE-307 in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies to characterize potency and selectivity for M1R over M2-5R and confirm the sufficiency of blocking this receptor to promote differentiation and remyelination. Further, PIPE-307 displays significant efficacy in the mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS as evaluated by quantifying disability, histology, electron microscopy, and visual evoked potentials. Together, these findings support targeting M1R for remyelination and support further development of PIPE-307 for clinical studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Poon","given":"Michael M."},{"family":"Lorrain","given":"Kym I."},{"family":"Stebbins","given":"Karin J."},{"family":"Edu","given":"Geraldine C."},{"family":"Broadhead","given":"Alexander R."},{"family":"Lorenzana","given":"Ariana J."},{"family":"Roppe","given":"Jeffrey R."},{"family":"Baccei","given":"Jill M."},{"family":"Baccei","given":"Christopher S."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Austin C."},{"family":"Green","given":"Ari J."},{"family":"Lorrain","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Chan","given":"Jonah R."}],"citation-key":"poonTargetingMuscarinicM12024","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

ACT-1004-1239, a first-in-class and potent ACKR3 antagonist, currently undergoing clinical development, showed promise in preclinical MS models, reducing neuroinflammation and demyelination. However, its effectiveness in treating established disease and impact on remyelination after the occurrence of demyelinated lesions remain unexplored. This study assessed the therapeutic effect of ACT-1004-1239 in two demyelinating disease models. In the proteolipid protein (PLP)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, ACT-1004-1239 administered upon the detection of the first signs of paralysis, resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in EAE disease severity, concomitant with diminished immune cell infiltrates in the CNS and reduced demyelination. Notably, efficacy correlated with elevated plasma concentrations of CXCL11 and CXCL12, two pharmacodynamic biomarkers of ACKR3 antagonism. Combining ACT-1004-1239 with siponimod, an approved immunomodulatory treatment for MS, synergistically reduced EAE severity. In the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, ACT-1004-1239 administered after 5 weeks of cuprizone exposure, significantly accelerated remyelination, already quantifiable one week after cuprizone withdrawal. Additionally, ACT-1004-1239 penetrated the CNS, elevating brain CXCL12 concentrations. These results demonstrate that ACKR3 antagonism significantly reduces the severity of experimental demyelinating diseases, even when treatment is initiated therapeutically, after the occurrence of lesions. It confirms the dual mode of action of ACT-1004-1239, exhibiting both immunomodulatory effects by reducing neuroinflammation and promyelinating effects by accelerating myelin repair. The results further strengthen the rationale for evaluating ACT-1004-1239 in clinical trials for patients with demyelinating diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pouzol","given":"Laetitia"},{"family":"Sassi","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Tunis","given":"Mélanie"},{"family":"Zurbach","given":"Anaïs"},{"family":"Baumlin","given":"Nadège"},{"family":"Gnerre","given":"Carmela"},{"family":"Strasser","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Marrie","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Vezzali","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Martinic","given":"Marianne M."}],"citation-key":"pouzolACKR3AntagonismEnhances2024","container-title":"Neurochemical Research","container-title-short":"Neurochem Res","DOI":"10.1007/s11064-024-04173-1","ISSN":"0364-3190, 1573-6903","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8]]},"language":"en","page":"2087-2104","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"ACKR3 Antagonism Enhances the Repair of Demyelinated Lesions Through Both Immunomodulatory and Remyelinating Effects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11064-024-04173-1","volume":"49"},{"id":"pouzolACT10041239FirstinclassCXCR72021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pouzol","given":"Laetitia"},{"family":"Baumlin","given":"Nadège"},{"family":"Sassi","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Tunis","given":"Mélanie"},{"family":"Marrie","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Vezzali","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Farine","given":"Hervé"},{"family":"Mentzel","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Martinic","given":"Marianne M."}],"citation-key":"pouzolACT10041239FirstinclassCXCR72021","container-title":"The FASEB Journal","container-title-short":"FASEB j.","DOI":"10.1096/fj.202002465R","ISSN":"0892-6638, 1530-6860","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"ACT‐1004‐1239, a first‐in‐class CXCR7 antagonist with both immunomodulatory and promyelinating effects for the treatment of inflammatory demyelinating diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fj.202002465R","volume":"35"},{"id":"pradoGPR43StimulationTCRav2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Introduction\n              \n                Gut microbiota plays a critical role in the regulation of immune homeostasis.

The neurodegenerative disease was induced in a mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model with translational value to detect neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis. Following the treatment with the BK channel openers, BMS-204253 and VSN16R, neuroprotection was assessed using subjective and objective clinical outcomes and by quantitating spinal nerve content. Treatment with BMS-204253 and VSN16R did not inhibit the development of relapsing autoimmunity, consistent with minimal channel expression via immune cells, nor did it change leukocyte levels in rodents or humans. However, it inhibited the accumulation of nerve loss and disability as a consequence of autoimmunity. Therefore, in addition to symptom control, BK channel openers have the potential to save nerves from excitotoxic damage and could be useful as either stand-alone neuroprotective agents or as add-ons to current disease-modifying treatments that block relapsing MS but do not have any direct neuroprotective activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pryce","given":"Gareth"},{"family":"Sisay","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Giovannoni","given":"Gavin"},{"family":"Selwood","given":"David L."},{"family":"Baker","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"pryceNeuroprotectionExperimentalModel2023","container-title":"Pharmaceuticals","container-title-short":"Pharmaceuticals","DOI":"10.3390/ph16070972","ISSN":"1424-8247","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,7]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"972","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neuroprotection in an Experimental Model of Multiple Sclerosis via Opening of Big Conductance, Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/16/7/972","volume":"16"},{"id":"PublishOnlinea","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,6]]},"citation-key":"PublishOnlinea","language":"en","title":"Publish Online","type":"webpage","URL":"https://indd.adobe.com/view/44fea635-3249-4539-bbd1-370eb4fd4708?allowFullscreen=true&wmode=opaque"},{"id":"puceSpasticitySpasticDystonia2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Puce","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Currà","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Marinelli","given":"Lucio"},{"family":"Mori","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Capello","given":"Elisabetta"},{"family":"Di Giovanni","given":"Rachele"},{"family":"Bodrero","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Solaro","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Cotellessa","given":"Filippo"},{"family":"Fattapposta","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Trompetto","given":"Carlo"}],"citation-key":"puceSpasticitySpasticDystonia2021","container-title":"Clinical Neurophysiology Practice","container-title-short":"Clinical Neurophysiology Practice","DOI":"10.1016/j.cnp.2021.05.002","ISSN":"2467981X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"194-202","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Spasticity, spastic dystonia, and static stretch reflex in hypertonic muscles of patients with multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2467981X21000287","volume":"6"},{"id":"puranikExploringRoleStem2022","abstract":":\n              Several human neurological disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease,\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and brain\nstroke, are caused by the injury to neurons or glial cells.

Numerous complex intracellular signaling and transcriptional factors regulate the differentiation process from OPCs to mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) and myelination.

Plasma exchange is well established for various neurological disorders, and it is applied successfully in central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating diseases (CNS-IDD). It mainly modulates the humoral immune system; thus, it has a greater theoretical effect in diseases with prominent humoral mechanisms, such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO). However, it also has a proven therapeutic effect in multiple sclerosis (MS) attacks. Several studies have suggested that patients with severe attacks of CNS-IDD have poor response to steroid therapy but show clinical improvement after the PLEX treatment. Currently, PLEX is generally established only as a rescue therapy for steroid unresponsive relapses. However, there are still research gaps in the literature regarding plasma volume, number of sessions, and how early the apheresis treatment needs to started. Thus, in the present article, we summarize the clinical studies and meta-analyses, especially about MS and NMO, outlining clinical data regarding the experience with therapeutic PLEX in severe attacks of CNS-IDD, the clinical improvement rates, the prognostic factors of a favorable response, and highlighting the likely role of the early apheresis treatment. Further, we have gathered this evidence and suggested a protocol for the treatment of CNS-IDD with PLEX in the routine clinical practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Queiroz","given":"André Luiz Guimarães De"},{"family":"Soares Neto","given":"Herval Ribeiro"},{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Thiago Taya"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Sonia Maria Cesar De Azevedo"}],"citation-key":"queirozPlasmaExchangeInflammatory2023","container-title":"Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria","container-title-short":"Arq Neuropsiquiatr","DOI":"10.1055/s-0042-1758447","ISSN":"0004-282X, 1678-4227","issue":"03","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"296-307","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Plasma exchange in inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system: reasonable use in the clinical practice","title-short":"Plasma exchange in inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-0042-1758447","volume":"81"},{"id":"quesenberryFixYourSocial2016","abstract":"Here’s where to start.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Quesenberry","given":"Keith A."}],"citation-key":"quesenberryFixYourSocial2016","container-title":"Harvard Business Review","ISSN":"0017-8012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,25]]},"section":"Sales and marketing","source":"hbr.org","title":"Fix Your Social Media Strategy by Taking It Back to Basics","type":"article-magazine","URL":"https://hbr.org/2016/07/fix-your-social-media-strategy-by-taking-it-back-to-basics"},{"id":"QueSustentabilidadeBCSD2019","abstract":"A sustentabilidade é a capacidade de satisfazer as nossas necessidades no presente sem comprometer a capacidade das gerações futuras satisfazerem as suas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"citation-key":"QueSustentabilidadeBCSD2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,16]]},"language":"pt-PT","title":"O que é a sustentabilidade? | BCSD Portugal","title-short":"O que é a sustentabilidade?","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://bcsdportugal.org/sustentabilidade/"},{"id":"quideCerebellarTissueProperties2025","abstract":"Fibromyalgia is associated with elevated levels of comorbid anxiety and depression, together impacting brain morphology possibly reflecting common underlying biological processes. The present study aims to determine the difference in regional myelination in females with fibromyalgia compared to females who do not experience chronic pain and determine the role of the severity of comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms experienced to mediate this difference in brain myelination. Thirty-three females with and 33 females without (Controls) fibromyalgia were included, for which the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms were recorded using the Hamilton Anxiety/Depression Rating scales (HAMA/HAMD). Whole-brain three-dimensional T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected, and T1w/T2w ratio (myelin maps) derived. Mediation analyses were performed with anxiety and depressive symptoms as mediators of the T1w/T2w ratio differences among the groups. Compared to the control group, the fibromyalgia group lower T1w/T2w values in the left cerebellar lobule VI (pFWEc=0.030) and left cerebellar lobule VIII (pFWEc=0.029). These T1w/T2w values were significantly negatively associated with severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms (all p&lt;0.001). Mediation analyses indicated that the severity of anxiety (but not depressive) symptoms mediated the group difference in T1w/T2w values in cerebellar lobule VI (p=0.012), but not VIII (p=0.813). Lowered cerebellar myelination may reflect chronic states of low-grade inflammation, resulting from the long-term consequences of living with fibromyalgia and related anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Acute TBI treatments are needed that protect against axon damage and promote recovery of axon function to prevent long term symptoms and neurodegeneration. Our prior characterization of axon damage and demyelination after TBI led us to examine repurposing of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), an FDA-approved inhibitor of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. 4-AP is currently indicated to provide symptomatic relief for patients with chronic stage multiple sclerosis, which involves axon damage and demyelination. We tested clinically relevant dosage of 4-AP as an acute treatment for experimental TBI and found multiple benefits in corpus callosum axons. This randomized, controlled pre-clinical study focused on the first week after TBI, when axons are particularly vulnerable. 4-AP treatment initiated one day post-injury dramatically reduced axon damage detected by intra-axonal fluorescence accumulations in Thy1-YFP mice of both sexes. Detailed electron microscopy in C57BL/6 mice showed that 4-AP reduced pathological features of mitochondrial swelling, cytoskeletal disruption, and demyelination at 7 days post-injury. Furthermore, 4-AP improved the molecular organization of axon nodal regions by restoring disrupted paranode domains and reducing Kv1.2 channel dispersion. 4-AP treatment did not resolve deficits in action potential conduction across the corpus callosum, based on ex vivo electrophysiological recordings at 7 days post-TBI. Thus, this first study of 4-AP effects on axon damage in the acute period demonstrates a significant decrease in multiple pathological hallmarks of axon damage after experimental TBI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Radomski","given":"Kryslaine L."},{"family":"Zi","given":"Xiaomei"},{"family":"Lischka","given":"Fritz W."},{"family":"Noble","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Galdzicki","given":"Zygmunt"},{"family":"Armstrong","given":"Regina C."}],"citation-key":"radomskiAcuteAxonDamage2022","container-title":"Acta Neuropathologica Communications","container-title-short":"acta neuropathol commun","DOI":"10.1186/s40478-022-01366-z","ISSN":"2051-5960","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"en","page":"67","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Acute axon damage and demyelination are mitigated by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) therapy after experimental traumatic brain injury","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-022-01366-z","volume":"10"},{"id":"rahimanInsightRoleLiposomal2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Rahiman","given":"Niloufar"},{"family":"Zamani","given":"Parvin"},{"family":"Badiee","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Arabi","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Alavizadeh","given":"Seyedeh Hoda"},{"family":"Jaafari","given":"Mahmoud Reza"}],"citation-key":"rahimanInsightRoleLiposomal2021","container-title":"Expert Opinion on Drug Delivery","container-title-short":"Expert Opinion on Drug Delivery","DOI":"10.1080/17425247.2021.2003327","ISSN":"1742-5247, 1744-7593","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1795-1813","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An insight into the role of liposomal therapeutics in the reversion of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17425247.2021.2003327","volume":"18"},{"id":"rahimanRecentAdvancementsNanoparticlemediated2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Rahiman","given":"Niloufar"},{"family":"Mohammadi","given":"Marzieh"},{"family":"Alavizadeh","given":"Seyedeh Hoda"},{"family":"Arabi","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Badiee","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Jaafari","given":"Mahmoud Reza"}],"citation-key":"rahimanRecentAdvancementsNanoparticlemediated2022","container-title":"Journal of Controlled Release","container-title-short":"Journal of Controlled Release","DOI":"10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.02.009","ISSN":"01683659","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","page":"620-644","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recent advancements in nanoparticle-mediated approaches for restoration of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168365922000839","volume":"343"},{"id":"rahimidarehbaghStemCellTherapies2024","abstract":"Stem cell-based therapies have emerged as a promising approach for treating various neurological disorders by harnessing the regenerative potential of stem cells to restore damaged neural tissue and circuitry. This comprehensive review provides an in-depth analysis of the current state of stem cell applications in primary neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and other related disorders. The review begins with a detailed introduction to stem cell biology, discussing the types, sources, and mechanisms of action of stem cells in neurological therapies. It then critically examines the preclinical evidence from animal models and early human trials investigating the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of different stem cell types, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). While ESCs have been studied extensively in preclinical models, clinical trials have primarily focused on adult stem cells such as MSCs and NSCs, as well as iPSCs and their derivatives. We critically assess the current state of research for each cell type, highlighting their potential applications and limitations in different neurological conditions. The review synthesizes key findings from recent, high-quality studies for each neurological condition, discussing cell manufacturing, delivery methods, and therapeutic outcomes. While the potential of stem cells to replace lost neurons and directly reconstruct neural circuits is highlighted, the review emphasizes the critical role of paracrine and immunomodulatory mechanisms in mediating the therapeutic effects of stem cells in most neurological disorders. The article also explores the challenges and limitations associated with translating stem cell therapies into clinical practice, including issues related to cell sourcing, scalability, safety, and regulatory considerations. Furthermore, it discusses future directions and opportunities for advancing stem cell-based treatments, such as gene editing, biomaterials, personalized iPSC-derived therapies, and novel delivery strategies. The review concludes by emphasizing the transformative potential of stem cell therapies in revolutionizing the treatment of neurological disorders while acknowledging the need for rigorous clinical trials, standardized protocols, and multidisciplinary collaboration to realize their full therapeutic promise.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Rahimi Darehbagh","given":"Ramyar"},{"family":"Seyedoshohadaei","given":"Seyedeh Asrin"},{"family":"Ramezani","given":"Rojin"},{"family":"Rezaei","given":"Nima"}],"citation-key":"rahimidarehbaghStemCellTherapies2024","container-title":"European Journal of Medical Research","container-title-short":"European Journal of Medical Research","DOI":"10.1186/s40001-024-01987-1","ISSN":"2047-783X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"language":"en","page":"386","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Stem cell therapies for neurological disorders: current progress, challenges, and future perspectives","title-short":"Stem cell therapies for neurological disorders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-024-01987-1","volume":"29"},{"id":"rahimlouProbioticSupplementationSystemic2022","abstract":"Background\n              Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex inflammatory disease in which demyelination occurs in the central nervous system affecting approximately 2.5 million people worldwide.

MS commonly affects the cerebellum causing acute and chronic symptoms. Cerebellar signs significantly contribute to clinical disability, and symptoms such as tremor, ataxia, and dysarthria are difficult to treat. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) are involved in demyelinating pathologies such as MS. In autopsy tissue from patients with MS, increased expression of FGF1, FGF2, FGF9, and FGFR1 was found in lesion areas. Recent research using mouse models has focused on regions such as the spinal cord, and data on the expression of FGF/FGFR in the cerebellum are not available. In recent EAE studies, we detected that oligodendrocyte-specific deletion of FGFRs results in a milder disease course, less cellular infiltrates, and reduced neurodegeneration in the spinal cord. The objective of this study was to characterize the role of FGFR1 in oligodendrocytes in the cerebellum. Conditional deletion of FGFR1 in oligodendrocytes (Fgfr1ind−/−) was achieved by tamoxifen application, EAE was induced using the MOG35-55 peptide. The cerebellum was analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and western blot. At day 62 p.i., Fgfr1ind−/− mice showed less myelin and axonal degeneration compared to FGFR1-competent mice. Infiltration of CD3(+) T cells, Mac3(+) cells, B220(+) B cells and IgG(+) plasma cells in cerebellar white matter lesions (WML) was less in Fgfr1ind−/−mice. There were no effects on the number of OPC or mature oligodendrocytes in white matter lesion (WML). Expression of FGF2 and FGF9 associated with less myelin and axonal degeneration, and of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and CD200 was downregulated in Fgfr1ind−/− mice. The FGF/FGFR signaling protein pAkt, BDNF, and TrkB were increased in Fgfr1ind−/− mice. These data suggest that cell-specific deletion of FGFR1 in oligodendrocytes has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in the cerebellum in the EAE disease model of MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Rajendran","given":"Ranjithkumar"},{"family":"Rajendran","given":"Vinothkumar"},{"family":"Giraldo-Velasquez","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Megalofonou","given":"Fevronia-Foivi"},{"family":"Gurski","given":"Fynn"},{"family":"Stadelmann","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Karnati","given":"Srikanth"},{"family":"Berghoff","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"rajendranOligodendrocyteSpecificDeletionFGFR12021","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms22179495","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,31]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"9495","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Oligodendrocyte-Specific Deletion of FGFR1 Reduces Cerebellar Inflammation and Neurodegeneration in MOG35-55-Induced EAE","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/17/9495","volume":"22"},{"id":"rajendranSmallMoleculeFibroblast2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background and Purpose\n              \n                Fibroblast growth factors and receptors (FGFR) have been shown to modulate inflammation and neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS).

Disruption of this balance can result in autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) targeting TGF‐β signaling have been shown to be upregulated in naïve CD4 T cells in MS patients, resulting in a limited in vitro generation of human Tregs. Utilizing the murine model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we show that perinatal administration of miRNAs, which target the TGF‐β signaling pathway, enhanced susceptibility to central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity. Neonatal mice administered with these miRNAs further exhibited reduced Treg frequencies with a loss in T cell receptor repertoire diversity following the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in adulthood. Exacerbated CNS autoimmunity as a result of miRNA overexpression in CD4 T cells was accompanied by enhanced Th1 and Th17 cell frequencies. These findings demonstrate that increased levels of TGF‐β‐associated miRNAs impede the development of a diverse Treg population, leading to enhanced effector cell activity, and contributing to an increased susceptibility to CNS autoimmunity. Thus, TGF‐β‐targeting miRNAs could be a risk factor for MS, and recovering optimal TGF‐β signaling may restore immune homeostasis in MS patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Rau","given":"Christina N."},{"family":"Severin","given":"Mary E."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Priscilla W."},{"family":"Deffenbaugh","given":"Joshua L."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Shawn P."},{"family":"Petersen‐Cherubini","given":"Cora L."},{"family":"Lovett‐Racke","given":"Amy E."}],"citation-key":"rauMicroRNAsTargetingTGFv2024","container-title":"European Journal of Immunology","container-title-short":"Eur J Immunol","DOI":"10.1002/eji.202350548","ISSN":"0014-2980, 1521-4141","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6]]},"language":"en","page":"2350548","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"MicroRNAs targeting TGF‐β signaling exacerbate central nervous system autoimmunity by disrupting regulatory T cell development and function","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eji.202350548","volume":"54"},{"id":"ravariaMolecularMechanismsNeuroprotective2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural phenolic compound present in culinary herbs of the\n              Boraginaceae\n              ,\n              Lamiaceae\n              /\n              Labiatae\n              , and\n              Nepetoideae\n              families.

In particular, several studies have confirmed the neuroprotective potential of RA in multiple cellular and animal models, as well as in clinical studies. The neuroprotective effects mediated by RA stem from its multimodal actions on a plethora of cellular and molecular pathways; including oxidative, bioenergetic, neuroinflammatory, and synaptic signaling. In recent years, RA has garnered tremendous interest as an ideal therapeutic candidate for treating neurodegenerative diseases. This review first briefly discusses the pharmacokinetics of RA and then proceeds to detail the neuroprotective mechanisms of RA at the molecular levels.

Probiotics perform as an immunomodulator because they regulate the host’s immune responses. Its efficacy gets enhanced for an extended period when it combines with prebiotics. In this review, we focus on the metabolic alterations behind the MS lesions via the Warburg effect, and also suggesting, the combined efficacy of prebiotics and probiotics for the effective treatment of MS without side effects. The Warburg effect mechanism intensifies the infiltration of activated T-cells and B-cells into the CNS. It provokes the inflammation process on the myelin sheath.

Despite extensive studies, its binary roles— EITHER aggravating injury or promoting recovery—make a conclusive translational decision on its modulation strategy elusive. Analyzing two liver regeneration models, autoimmune hepatitis and direct hepatic damage, we discovered Par2’s outcome depends on the injury’s nature. In immune-mediated injury, Par2 exacerbates damage, while in direct tissue injury, it promotes regeneration. Subsequently, we evaluated the clinical significance of this finding by investigating Par2’s expression in the context of autoimmune diabetes. We found that the absence of Par2 in all lymphocytes provided full protection against the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in mice, whereas the introduction of a β-cell-specific Par2 null mutation accelerated the onset of autoimmune diabetes. This pattern led us to hypothesize whether these observations are universal. A comprehensive review of recent Par2 publications across tissues and systems confirms the claim drafted above: Par2’s initial activation in the immune system aggravates inflammation, hindering recovery, whereas its primary activation in the damaged tissue fosters regeneration. As a membrane-anchored receptor, Par2 emerges as an attractive drug target. Our findings highlight a crucial translational modulation strategy in regenerative medicine based on injury type.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Reches","given":"Gal"},{"family":"Piran","given":"Ron"}],"citation-key":"rechesPar2mediatedResponsesInflammation2024","container-title":"Inflammation and Regeneration","container-title-short":"Inflamm Regener","DOI":"10.1186/s41232-024-00338-1","ISSN":"1880-8190","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,30]]},"language":"en","page":"26","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Par2-mediated responses in inflammation and regeneration: choosing between repair and damage","title-short":"Par2-mediated responses in inflammation and regeneration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://inflammregen.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41232-024-00338-1","volume":"44"},{"id":"reichSafetyEfficacyTolebrutinib2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Reich","given":"Daniel S"},{"family":"Arnold","given":"Douglas L"},{"family":"Vermersch","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Bar-Or","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Fox","given":"Robert J"},{"family":"Matta","given":"Andre"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Wallström","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xinyan"},{"family":"Mareš","given":"Miroslav"},{"family":"Khabirov","given":"Farit A"},{"family":"Traboulsee","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Grand'Maison","given":"Francois"},{"family":"Jacques","given":"Francois"},{"family":"Traboulsee","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Tyblova","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Meluzinova","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Ampapa","given":"Radek"},{"family":"Valis","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Hradilke","given":"Pavel"},{"family":"Mareš","given":"Miroslav"},{"family":"Stourac","given":"Pavel"},{"family":"Gross-Paju","given":"Katrin"},{"family":"Laplaud","given":"David"},{"family":"Mathey","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Uitdehaag","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Evdoshenkoo","given":"Evgeny"},{"family":"Popova","given":"Ekaterina"},{"family":"Zakharova","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Totolyan","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Litvinenko","given":"Igor"},{"family":"Khabirov","given":"Farit"},{"family":"Sivertseva","given":"Stella"},{"family":"Hancinova","given":"Viera"},{"family":"Kantorova","given":"Ema"},{"family":"Gines","given":"Maria Luisa Martinez"},{"family":"Montalban","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Maduano","given":"Sara Eichau"},{"family":"Meca-Lallana","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Ramió-Torrentà","given":"Lluís"},{"family":"Nehrych","given":"Tetyanna"},{"family":"Pashkovskyy","given":"Valeriy"},{"family":"Moskovko","given":"Sergii"},{"family":"Kalbus","given":"Oleksandr"},{"family":"Khavunka","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Pryshchepa","given":"Volodymyr"},{"family":"Goloborodko","given":"Alla"},{"family":"Wynn","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Honeycutt","given":"William"},{"family":"Wray","given":"Sibyl"},{"family":"Steingo","given":"Brian"},{"family":"LaGanke","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Deren"},{"family":"Hemphill","given":"John Michael"},{"family":"Goldstick","given":"Lawrence"},{"family":"Robertson","given":"Derrick"}],"citation-key":"reichSafetyEfficacyTolebrutinib2021","container-title":"The Lancet Neurology","container-title-short":"The Lancet Neurology","DOI":"10.1016/S1474-4422(21)00237-4","ISSN":"14744422","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"en","page":"729-738","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Safety and efficacy of tolebrutinib, an oral brain-penetrant BTK inhibitor, in relapsing multiple sclerosis: a phase 2b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","title-short":"Safety and efficacy of tolebrutinib, an oral brain-penetrant BTK inhibitor, in relapsing multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474442221002374","volume":"20"},{"id":"Relations2019","author":[{"family":"Relations'","given":"`Public"}],"citation-key":"Relations2019","issue":"brunoamaral","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7]]},"title":"In *Wikipedia*","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Public_relations&oldid=908763562>","volume":"31"},{"id":"relloGoodFontsDyslexia2013","abstract":"Around 10% of the people have dyslexia, a neurological disability that impairs a person's ability to read and write.

Three PwMS randomly received both 3 mA tDCS and SHAM targeting the motor cortex (M1) that controls the more-affected leg for 20 min on separate days before walking on a treadmill. The radiotracer, FDG, was injected at minute two of the 20 min walk and the subjects underwent a Positron emission tomography (PET) scan immediately after the task. Differences in relative regional metabolism of areas under the tDCS anode and the basal ganglia were calculated and investigated. The results indicated diverse and individualized responses in regions under the anode and consistent increases in some basal ganglia areas (e.g., caudate nucleus). Thus, anodal tDCS targeting the M1 that controls the more-affected leg of PwMS might be capable of affecting remote subcortical regions and modulating the activity (motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions) of the circuitry connected to these regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Rudroff","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Fietsam","given":"Alexandra C."},{"family":"Deters","given":"Justin R."},{"family":"Workman","given":"Craig D."},{"family":"Boles Ponto","given":"Laura L."}],"citation-key":"rudroffEffectsTranscranialDirect2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

The MSCs have the capacity to differentiate into cells of the embryonic tissue, such as the mesoderm. So, these cells can be found in a variety of tissues. Also, the MSCs can release immunomodulatory and neurotrophic factors performance as inflammation mediators operating in injured tissue regeneration. Furthermore, they can differentiate into neural-like cells in vitro. Thereby, because of the high immunomodulatory role of MSCs, this review sought to describe the main immunomodulatory mechanisms performed by MSCs in CNS recovery after tissue injury or neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: PubMed and ScienceDirect were searched between January 2011 to March 2021, and 43 articles met the criteria of the review. Results: This systematic review indicates that MSCs were used in vivo experimental multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ischemic stroke, and traumatic brain injury. The treatment MSCs were usually from human origin, derived from bone marrow, and administered intravenously. Conclusion: It was shown that MSCs, independent from origin or administration pathway, can reduce inflammation and help in the recovery and preservation of injured neural tissue. Thus, the use of MSCs represents a potential therapeutic option in the treatment of neurological disorders mediated by inflammatory processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Rufino","given":"Rodrigo De Andrade"},{"family":"Pereira-Rufino","given":"Laís Da Silva"},{"family":"Vissoto","given":"Thays Cristina Silva"},{"family":"Kerkis","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Neves","given":"Adriana Da Costa"},{"family":"Da Silva","given":"Marcelo Cavenaghi Pereira"}],"citation-key":"rufinoImmunomodulatoryPotentialRole2022","container-title":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","container-title-short":"Neurodegener Dis","DOI":"10.1159/000528036","ISSN":"1660-2854, 1660-2862","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"68-82","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Immunomodulatory Potential Role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Diseases of the Central Nervous System","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://karger.com/NDD/article/doi/10.1159/000528036","volume":"22"},{"id":"ruizEndothelialCellderivedOxysterol2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            The vasculature is a key regulator of leukocyte trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS) during inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the impact of endothelial‐derived factors on CNS immune responses remains unknown. Bioactive lipids, in particular oxysterols downstream of Cholesterol‐25‐hydroxylase (Ch25h), promote neuroinflammation but their functions in the CNS are not well‐understood. Using floxed‐reporter Ch25h knock‐in mice, we trace Ch25h expression to CNS endothelial cells (ECs) and myeloid cells and demonstrate that Ch25h ablation specifically from ECs attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mechanistically, inflamed Ch25h‐deficient CNS ECs display altered lipid metabolism favoring polymorphonuclear myeloid‐derived suppressor cell (PMN‐MDSC) expansion, which suppresses encephalitogenic T lymphocyte proliferation. Additionally, endothelial Ch25h‐deficiency combined with immature neutrophil mobilization into the blood circulation nearly completely protects mice from EAE. Our findings reveal a central role for CNS endothelial Ch25h in promoting neuroinflammation by inhibiting the expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations.\n          , \n            Synopsis\n            \n              \n                \n                  image\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              Cholesterol 25‐hydroxylase (Ch25h) expression increases in central nervous system‐endothelial cells (ECs) during inflammation and regulates lipid secretion.

Inappropriate response of T-cells to myelin antigens has an essential role in the pathophysiology of MS. The clinical and pathophysiological complications of MS necessitate identification of potential molecular targets to understand the pathogenic events of MS. Since the functions and regulatory mechanisms of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in MS are yet uncertain, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis to explain the lncRNA-associated ceRNA axes to clarify molecular regulatory mechanisms involved in T-cells responses in MS. Two microarray datasets of peripheral blood T-cell from subjects with relapsing-remitting MS and matched controls containing data about miRNAs (GSE43590), mRNAs and lncRNAs (GSE43591) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), mRNAs (DEmRNAs), and lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were identified by the limma package of the R software. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module were developed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) and the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) Cytoscape plugin, respectively. Using DIANA-LncBase and miRTarBase, the lncRNA-associated ceRNA axes was constructed. We conducted a Pearson correlation analysis and selected the positive correlations among the lncRNAs and mRNAs in the ceRNA axes. Lastly, DEmRNAs pathway enrichment was conducted by the Enrichr tool.

Interestingly, curcumin, a natural polyphenol, showed a neuroprotective effect in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including MS. Nevertheless, the influence of curcumin against MS-induced cognitive impairment is still vague. Hence, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice using spinal cord homogenate (SCH) and complete Freund’s adjuvant, which eventually mimic MS. This study aimed not only to evaluate curcumin efficacy against EAE-induced cognitive and motor dysfunction, but also to explore a novel mechanism of action, by which curcumin exerts its beneficial effects in MS. Curcumin (200 mg/kg/day) efficacy was evaluated by behavioral tests, histopathological examination, and biochemical tests. Concisely, curcumin amended EAE-induced cognitive and motor impairments, as demonstrated by the behavioral tests and histopathological examination of the hippocampus. Interestingly, curcumin activated the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase/silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (AMPK/SIRT1) axis, which triggered cyclic AMP response element-binding protein/brain-derived neurotrophic factor/myelin basic protein (CREB/BDNF/MBP) pathway, hindering demyelination of the corpus callosum. Furthermore, AMPK/SIRT1 activation augmented nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a powerful antioxidant, amending EAE-induced oxidative stress. Additionally, curcumin abolished EAE-induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting Janus kinase 2 /signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) axis, by various pathways, including AMPK/SIRT1 activation. JAK2/STAT3 inhibition halts inflammatory cytokines synthesis. In conclusion, curcumin’s neuroprotective effect in EAE is controlled, at least in part, by AMPK/SIRT1 activation, which ultimately minimizes EAE-induced neuronal demyelination, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation.\n            \n              Graphical Abstract\n            \n            Graphical illustration of putative molecular pathways implicated in the management of EAE by curcumin.

Moreover, curcumin conquers the inflammatory pathway JAK2/STAT3/NF-kβ.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sadek","given":"Mohamed A."},{"family":"Rabie","given":"Mostafa A."},{"family":"El Sayed","given":"Nesrine S."},{"family":"Sayed","given":"Helmy M."},{"family":"Kandil","given":"Esraa A."}],"citation-key":"sadekNeuroprotectiveEffectCurcumin2024","container-title":"Inflammopharmacology","container-title-short":"Inflammopharmacol","DOI":"10.1007/s10787-023-01399-3","ISSN":"0925-4692, 1568-5608","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4]]},"language":"en","page":"1499-1518","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neuroprotective effect of curcumin against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-induced cognitive and physical impairments in mice: an insight into the role of the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway","title-short":"Neuroprotective effect of curcumin against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-induced cognitive and physical impairments in mice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10787-023-01399-3","volume":"32"},{"id":"sadekSemaglutideNovelGlucagonlike2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sadek","given":"Mohamed A"},{"family":"Kandil","given":"Esraa A"},{"family":"El Sayed","given":"Nesrine S"},{"family":"Sayed","given":"Helmy M"},{"family":"Rabie","given":"Mostafa A"}],"citation-key":"sadekSemaglutideNovelGlucagonlike2023","container-title":"International Immunopharmacology","container-title-short":"International Immunopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109647","ISSN":"15675769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"en","page":"109647","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Semaglutide, a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, amends experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-induced multiple sclerosis in mice: Involvement of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway","title-short":"Semaglutide, a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, amends experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-induced multiple sclerosis in mice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567576922011328","volume":"115"},{"id":"saezRatFacialNerve2019","abstract":"Facial paralysis can result in severe implications for the patients. However, stem cell biology has become an important field in regenerative medicine since the discovery and characterization of mesenchymal stem cells. Our aim was to evaluate the regeneration after facial nerve crush injury and application of human immature dental pulp stem cells (iDPSC). For this study 70 Wistar rats underwent a unilateral facial nerve crush injury and were divided into two groups: Group I (GI): Crushed; Group II (GII): Crushed and iDPSC, and distributed into study periods of 3, 7, 14, 21, and 42 postoperative days. Facial nerve regeneration was analyzed via functional recovery of whisker movement, histomorphometric analysis, and immunoblotting assay. The results show that GII had complete functional recovery at 14 days, while GI recovered after 42 days. Also, regarding the facial nerve trunk, GII presented histological improvement, evidencing better axonal and structural organization of the myelin sheath, and exhibited statistically higher values for the outer and inner perimeters and g-ratio. Nevertheless, GI exhibited statistically higher values for the thickness of myelin sheath. In the buccal branch, no differences were observed for all parameters between groups. At 42 days, both groups GI and GII were close to the levels observed for the control group. Concerning nerve growth factor expression, GII exhibited statistically greater values ( p < 0.05) compared with the control group at 7 days. In summary, a single injection of human iDPSC promoted a positive effect on regeneration of the facial nerve trunk after 14 days and provided an alternative to support regeneration following peripheral nerve injury.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Saez","given":"Daniel Martinez"},{"family":"Sasaki","given":"Robson Tetsuo"},{"family":"Martins","given":"Daniel De Oliveira"},{"family":"Chacur","given":"Marucia"},{"family":"Kerkis","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Da Silva","given":"Marcelo Cavenaghi Pereira"}],"citation-key":"saezRatFacialNerve2019","container-title":"Cell Transplantation","container-title-short":"Cell Transplant","DOI":"10.1177/0963689719854446","ISSN":"0963-6897, 1555-3892","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1573-1584","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rat Facial Nerve Regeneration with Human Immature Dental Pulp Stem Cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963689719854446","volume":"28"},{"id":"safwatVanillicAcidAmeliorates2023","abstract":"Objective: To investigate the effect of vanillic acid (VA) on a Cuprizone (Cup) demyelinating rat model and the mechanisms behind such effect. Methods: Thirty adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, Cuprizone, and VA groups. Cuprizone was administrated at a dose of 450 mg/kg per day orally via gastric gavage for 5 weeks. The nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was studied in an isolated sciatic nerve, and then the sciatic nerve was isolated for histopathological examination, electron microscope examination, immunohistochemical staining, and biochemical and PCR assay. The level of IL17 was detected using ELISA, while the antioxidant genes Nrf2, HO-1 expression at the level of mRNA, expression of the myelin basic protein (MBP), interferon-gamma factor (INF)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and apoptotic marker (caspase-3) were measured using immunohistochemistry in the sciatic nerve. Results: There was a significant reduction in NCV in Cup compared to normal rats (p < 0.001), which was markedly improved in the VA group (p < 0.001). EM and histopathological examination revealed significant demyelination and deterioration of the sciatic nerve fibers with significant improvement in the VA group. The level of IL17 as well as the expression of INF-γ and caspase-3 were significantly increased with a significant reduction in the expression of MBP, Nrf2, and HO-1 in the sciatic nerve (p < 0.01), and VA treatment significantly improved the studied parameters (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The current study demonstrated a neuroprotective effect for VA against the Cup-induced demyelinating rat model.

Superficial white matter (SWM), located between cortex and WM, comprises short association fibers supporting local connectivity. As SWM matures in the latter stages of development relative to deep WM structures, it may be particularly vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disruptions observed in SSDs. However, its complex fiber architecture and proximity to the cortex pose challenges for conventional diffusion tensor imaging.Methods To overcome these limitations, we applied an advanced diffusion MRI approach to assess fiber density (FD) in the SWM of 78 individuals with early psychosis (age 22.0±3.0, 45% female) and 78 controls (age 21.8±3.2, 45% female).Results Early psychosis individuals showed widespread reductions in SWM FD, particularly in occipital, temporal, parietal, and insular regions, whereas no significant group differences were detected using fractional anisotropy from tensor imaging. FD reductions were associated with reduced cortical thickness (p&lt;0.0005, r=0.32) and surface area (p=0.006, r=0.23), indicating coordinated cortex-WM alterations. SWM FD was associated with processing speed (p=0.0029) and working memory (p=0.048). Further, SWM mediated the relationship between cortical structure and processing speed in frontal and parietal regions.Conclusions These findings highlight SWM, supporting local network connectivity, as a tissue compartment showing widespread alterations in SSDs. By implementing an advanced diffusion MRI technique, we were able to assess changes that were specific to the complex WM at the cortical boundary, and to demonstrate functionally important alterations in this difficult-to-characterize tissue compartment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementY.S. was supported by the Research Training Program Scholarship, and Japan Student Services Organization Scholarship.

Using metabolomics and in vivo experiments with both constitutive and oligodendrocyte‐selective carns1‐KO mouse models, we found that HDs are critical for oligodendrocyte survival and protect against oxidative stress. Carns1‐KO mouse models had lower numbers of mature oligodendrocytes, increased lipid peroxidation, and behavioral changes. Cuprizone administration, which increases reactive oxygen species in vivo, resulted in higher oligodendrocyte death, demyelination, axonal alterations, and oxidative damage in the corpus callosum of carns1‐KO mice. Gliosis and oxidative damage by cuprizone were prevented by pretreatment with the antioxidant N‐acetylcysteine. NADPH levels were increased threefold in the brains of carns1‐KO mice as an antioxidant response to oxidative stress through acceleration of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This was due to overexpression of glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate‐limiting enzyme of the PPP. Likewise, expression of NAD kinase, the biosynthetic enzyme for NADP+, and NAMPT, which replenishes the NAD+ pool, was higher in carns1‐KO mice brains than in controls. Our observations suggest that HDs cell‐autonomously protect oligodendrocytes from oxidative stress, with implications for demyelinating diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sajrawi","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Odeh","given":"Maali"},{"family":"Tiwari","given":"Akshay K."},{"family":"Agranovich","given":"Bella"},{"family":"Abramovich","given":"Ifat"},{"family":"Zubedat","given":"Salman"},{"family":"Saar","given":"Galit"},{"family":"Shaulov","given":"Lihi"},{"family":"Avital","given":"Avi"},{"family":"Reznik","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Benhar","given":"Moran"},{"family":"Radzishevsky","given":"Inna"},{"family":"Engelender","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Wolosker","given":"Herman"}],"citation-key":"sajrawiEndogenousHistidinePeptides2025","container-title":"Glia","container-title-short":"Glia","DOI":"10.1002/glia.24624","ISSN":"0894-1491, 1098-1136","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1]]},"language":"en","page":"122-139","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Endogenous histidine peptides are physiological antioxidants that prevent oligodendrocyte cell death and myelin loss in vivo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/glia.24624","volume":"73"},{"id":"salarvandsEffectivenessMassageTherapy2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Fatigue and pain are prevalent symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and frequent complaint in MS patients, which reduce their quality of life.

Proliferating cells including activated lymphocytes require deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) for DNA replication. dNTPs can be synthesised via the de novo pathway from precursors such as glucose and amino acids or the deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway from extracellular deoxyribonucleosides. Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) is the rate‐limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway. In prior work, we showed that targeting dCK with the small molecule inhibitor TRE‐515 limits clinical symptoms in two myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)‐induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse models of MS and decreases the levels of activated CD4 T and B lymphocytes in vivo. However, whether targeting dCK limits disease in additional EAE models and how targeting dCK directly impacts activated and proliferating CD4 T and B cells has yet to be determined. Here, we show that dCK is activated in the lymph nodes and spleen in an EAE model induced by amino acids 139–151 of the proteolipid protein (PLP\n              139‐151\n              ) that is driven by CD4 T and B cells and is characterised by acute disease followed by disease remission. Treating this model with TRE‐515 limits clinical symptoms and decreases the levels of activated CD4 T and B cells. In culture, CD4 T and B cells induce deoxyribonucleoside salvage following activation, and TRE‐515 directly blocks CD4 T and B cell activation‐induced proliferation and activation marker expression. TRE‐515 decreases deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) pools and increases the length of time cells spend in S phase of the cell cycle without inducing a replication stress response in B cells. Our results suggest that dCK activity is required to supply needed dNTPs and to enable rapid cell division following lymphocyte activation against autoantigens in EAE mouse models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Salas","given":"Jessica R."},{"family":"Ryan","given":"K.

This physiological response is coordinated by endogenous bioactive lipids known as specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). When resolution fails, inflammation becomes uncontrolled leading chronic inflammation and tissue damage, as occurs in multiple sclerosis (MS).\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              SPMs and the key biosynthetic enzymes involved in SPM production were analysed by metabololipidomics and qPCR in active brain lesions, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of MS patients as well as in the spinal cord of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We also tested the therapeutic actions of the SPM coined Maresin-1 (MaR1) in EAE mice and studied its impact on inflammation by doing luminex and flow cytometry analysis.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We show that levels of MaR1 and other SPMs were below the limit of detection or not increased in the spinal cord of EAE mice, whereas the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids was induced during disease progression. Similarly, we reveal that SPMs were undetected in serum and active brain lesion samples of MS patients, which was linked to impaired expression of the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathways of SPMs. We demonstrate that exogenous administration of MaR1 in EAE mice suppressed the protein levels of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced immune cells counts in the spinal cord and blood. MaR1 also decreased the numbers of Th1 cells but increased the accumulation of regulatory T cells and drove macrophage polarization towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Importantly, we provide clear evidence that administration of MaR1 in mice with clinical signs of EAE enhanced neurological outcomes and protected from demyelination.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study reveals that there is an imbalance in the production of SPMs in MS patients and in EAE mice, and that increasing the bioavailability of SPMs, such as MaR1, minimizes inflammation and mediates therapeutic actions.

Pre-clinical studies involving the use of neural stem cells (NSCs) have already demonstrated their potential in neuronal regeneration and remyelination. However, the exclusive application of cell therapy has not proved sufficient to achieve satisfactory therapeutic levels. Recognizing these limitations, there is a need to combine cell therapy with other adjuvant protocols. In this context, extracellular vesicles (EVs) can contribute to intercellular communication, stimulating the production of proteins and lipids associated with remyelination and providing trophic support to axons. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the combination of NSCs and EVs derived from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. OPCs were differentiated from NSCs and had their identity confirmed by gene expression analysis and immunocytochemistry. Exosomes were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and characterized by Western, transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Experimental therapy of C57BL/6 mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) were grouped in control, treated with NSCs, treated with OPC-derived EVs and treated with a combination of both. The treatments were evaluated clinically using scores and body weight, microscopically using immunohistochemistry and immunological profile by flow cytometry. The animals showed significant clinical improvement and weight gain with the treatments. However, only the treatments involving EVs led to immune modulation, changing the profile from Th1 to Th2 lymphocytes. Fifteen days after treatment revealed a reduction in reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis in the groups treated with EVs. However, there was no reduction in demyelination. The results indicate the potential therapeutic use of OPC-derived EVs to attenuate inflammation and promote recovery in EAE, especially when combined with cell therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Santos","given":"Sarah Ingrid Pinto"},{"family":"Ortiz-Peñuela","given":"Santiago José"},{"family":"De Paula Filho","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Tomiyama","given":"Ana Laura Midori Rossi"},{"family":"Coser","given":"Lilian De Oliveira"},{"family":"Da Silveira","given":"Juliano Coelho"},{"family":"Martins","given":"Daniele Dos Santos"},{"family":"Ciena","given":"Adriano Polican"},{"family":"De Oliveira","given":"Alexandre Leite Rodrigues"},{"family":"Ambrósio","given":"Carlos Eduardo"}],"citation-key":"santosOligodendrocytePrecursorCellderived2024","container-title":"Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

In this study, we leveraged single-shell diffusion MRI data from 297 older adults enrolled in the Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project to quantify fiber density (FD), cross-section (FC), and their composite (FDC) across primary (N1), secondary (N2), and tertiary (N3) fiber populations. By stratifying white matter into anatomically defined crossing-fiber convergence groups, we examined how fiber dominance and architectural complexity modulate associations with age, cognitive status, and longitudinal cognitive decline. Results revealed that FD and FDC in non-dominant (N2/N3) fibers were the strongest predictors of both baseline and longitudinal cognitive trajectories, particularly in memory and executive domains. These associations persisted across fiber convergence strata, suggesting that fiber population identity, rather than anatomical complexity, may confer greater vulnerability to age- and disease-related degeneration. Our findings position non-dominant fiber metrics as sensitive candidate biomarkers for early white matter disruption in Alzheimer’s disease and support the application of multi-fiber modeling to enhance detection of preclinical neurodegeneration.Competing Interest StatementTimothy J.

However, the physiological functions of many GPCRs and the involvement of them in autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that GPR141, an orphan GPCR belonging to the class A receptor family, suppresses immune responses. High GPR141 messenger RNA levels were expressed in myeloid-lineage cells, including neutrophils (CD11b + Gr1+), monocytes (CD11b + Gr1−Ly6C+ and CD11b + Gr1−Ly6C−), macrophages (F4/80+), and dendritic cells (CD11c+). Gpr141  −/− mice, which we independently generated, displayed almost no abnormalities in myeloid cell differentiation and compartmentalization in the spleen and bone marrow under steady-state conditions. However, Gpr141 deficiency exacerbated disease conditions of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an autoimmune disease model for multiple sclerosis, with increased inflammation in the spinal cord. Gpr141  −/− mice showed increased CD11b + Gr1+ neutrophils, CD11b + Gr1− monocytes, CD11c+ dendritic cells, and CD4+ T cell infiltration into the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis–induced spinal cord compared with littermate control mice. Lymphocytes enriched from Gpr141  −/− mice immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35–55 produced high amounts of interferon-γ, interleukin-17A, and interleukin-6 compared with those from wild-type mice. Moreover, CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) purified from Gpr141  −/− mice increased cytokine production of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35–55–specific T cells. These findings suggest that GPR141 functions as a negative regulator of immune responses by controlling the functions of monocytes and dendritic cells and that targeting GPR141 may be a possible therapeutic intervention for modulating chronic inflammatory diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sawabe","given":"Atsuya"},{"family":"Okazaki","given":"Shogo"},{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Akira"},{"family":"Goitsuka","given":"Ryo"},{"family":"Kaifu","given":"Tomonori"}],"citation-key":"sawabeOrphanProteinCoupled2024","container-title":"Journal of Leukocyte Biology","DOI":"10.1093/jleuko/qiae009","ISSN":"1938-3673","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,29]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/pages/standard-publication-reuse-rights","page":"935-945","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The orphan G protein–coupled receptor 141 expressed in myeloid cells functions as an inflammation suppressor","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jleukbio/article/115/5/935/7558432","volume":"115"},{"id":"scalaCpGmotifsToolDiscover2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              The investigation of molecular alterations associated with the conservation and variation of DNA methylation in eukaryotes is gaining interest in the biomedical research community.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of iNSC treatment on cellular, tissue, and functional recovery in a translational controlled cortical impact TBI piglet model. Five days post-craniectomy (n = 6) or TBI (n = 18), iNSCs (n = 7) or PBS (n = 11) were injected into perilesional brain tissue. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) neurological evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging, and immunohistochemistry were performed over the 12-week study period. At 12-weeks post-transplantation, iNSCs showed long-term engraftment and differentiation into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. iNSC treatment enhanced endogenous neuroprotective and regenerative activities indicated by decreasing intracerebral immune responses, preserving endogenous neurons, and increasing neuroblast formation. These cellular changes corresponded with decreased hemispheric atrophy, midline shift, and lesion volume as well as the preservation of cerebral blood flow. iNSC treatment increased piglet survival and decreased mRS scores. The results of this study in a predictive pediatric large-animal pig model demonstrate that iNSC treatment is a robust multimodal therapeutic that has significant promise in potentially treating human pediatric TBI patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Schantz","given":"Sarah L."},{"family":"Sneed","given":"Sydney E."},{"family":"Fagan","given":"Madison M."},{"family":"Golan","given":"Morgane E."},{"family":"Cheek","given":"Savannah R."},{"family":"Kinder","given":"Holly A."},{"family":"Duberstein","given":"Kylee J."},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Erin E."},{"family":"West","given":"Franklin D."}],"citation-key":"schantzHumanInducedPluripotentStem2024","container-title":"Biomedicines","container-title-short":"Biomedicines","DOI":"10.3390/biomedicines12081663","ISSN":"2227-9059","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1663","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Stem Cell Therapy Limits Tissue Damage and Promotes Tissue Regeneration and Functional Recovery in a Pediatric Piglet Traumatic-Brain-Injury Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/12/8/1663","volume":"12"},{"id":"scheibleEvobrutinibPathwayIts2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheible","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Schieferstein","given":"Hanno"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Ralf"},{"family":"Pusecker","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Gradhand","given":"Ulrike"},{"family":"Gopalakrishnan","given":"Sathej"},{"family":"Iqbal","given":"Khalid"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Reinaldo"},{"family":"Meli","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Bolleddula","given":"Jayaprakasam"},{"family":"Dyroff","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Georgi","given":"Katrin"}],"citation-key":"scheibleEvobrutinibPathwayIts2023","container-title":"Xenobiotica","container-title-short":"Xenobiotica","DOI":"10.1080/00498254.2023.2272180","ISSN":"0049-8254, 1366-5928","issue":"8-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,2]]},"language":"en","page":"547-558","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Evobrutinib pathway to its major metabolite M463-2 and insights from a biotransformation and DDI perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00498254.2023.2272180","volume":"53"},{"id":"schepersSelectivePDE4Subtype2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Schepers","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Paes","given":"Dean"},{"family":"Tiane","given":"Assia"},{"family":"Rombaut","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Piccart","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Van Veggel","given":"Lieve"},{"family":"Gervois","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Wolfs","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Lambrichts","given":"Ivo"},{"family":"Brullo","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Bruno","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Fedele","given":"Ernesto"},{"family":"Ricciarelli","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Constant","given":"Charles","non-dropping-particle":"ffrench-"},{"family":"Bechler","given":"Marie E."},{"family":"Van Schaik","given":"Pauline"},{"family":"Baron","given":"Wia"},{"family":"Lefevere","given":"Evy"},{"family":"Wasner","given":"Kobi"},{"family":"Grünewald","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Verfaillie","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Baeten","given":"Paulien"},{"family":"Broux","given":"Bieke"},{"family":"Wieringa","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Hellings","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Prickaerts","given":"Jos"},{"family":"Vanmierlo","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"schepersSelectivePDE4Subtype2023","container-title":"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","container-title-short":"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2022.12.020","ISSN":"08891591","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"language":"en","page":"1-22","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Selective PDE4 subtype inhibition provides new opportunities to intervene in neuroinflammatory versus myelin damaging hallmarks of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0889159122004780","volume":"109"},{"id":"schimrigksDronabinolSafeLongterm2017","abstract":"Treatment of neuropathic pain (NP) symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) is frequently insufficient.

Spontaneous restoration of myelin after demyelination occurs, but its efficiency declines during disease progression. Efficient myelin repair requires fine-tuning inflammatory responses by brain-resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages. Accordingly, promising therapeutic strategies aim at controlling inflammation to promote remyelination. Polysialic acid (polySia) is a polymeric glycan with variable chain lengths, presented as a posttranslational modification on select protein carriers. PolySia emerges as a negative regulator of inflammatory microglia and macrophage activation and has been detected on oligodendrocyte precursors and reactive astrocytes in multiple sclerosis lesions. As shown recently, polySia-modified proteins can also be released by activated microglia, and the intrinsically released protein-bound and exogenously applied free polySia were equally able to attenuate proinflammatory microglia activation via the inhibitory immune receptor Siglec-E. In this study, we explore polySia as a candidate substance for promoting myelin regeneration by immunomodulation. Lysophosphatidylcholine-induced demyelination of organotypic cerebellar slice cultures was used as an experimental model to analyze the impact of polySia with different degrees of polymerization (DP) on remyelination and inflammation. In lysophosphatidylcholine-treated cerebellar slice cultures, polySia-positive cells were abundant during demyelination but largely reduced during remyelination. Based on the determination of DP24 as the minimal polySia chain length required for the inhibition of inflammatory BV2 microglia activation, pools with short and long polySia chains (DP8–14 and DP24–30) were generated and applied to slice cultures during remyelination. Unlike DP8–14, treatment with DP24–30 significantly improved remyelination, increased arginase-1-positive microglia ratios, and reduced the production of nitric oxide in wildtype, but not in Siglec-E-deficient slice cultures.\n              In vitro\n              differentiation of oligodendrocytes was not affected by DP24–30. Collectively, these results suggest a beneficial effect of exogenously applied polySia DP24–30 on remyelination by Siglec-E-dependent microglia regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Schröder","given":"Lara-Jasmin"},{"family":"Thiesler","given":"Hauke"},{"family":"Gretenkort","given":"Lina"},{"family":"Möllenkamp","given":"Thiemo Malte"},{"family":"Stangel","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Gudi","given":"Viktoria"},{"family":"Hildebrandt","given":"Herbert"}],"citation-key":"schroderPolysialicAcidPromotes2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

The improvement of walking ability is a primary goal for rehabilitation treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) in association with physiotherapy treatment in patients affected by MS in comparison with ground conventional gait training. Study design: Randomized controlled crossover trial. Materials and Methods: Twenty-seven participants affected by MS with EDSS scores between 3.5 and 7 were enrolled, of whom seventeen completed the study. They received five training sessions per week over five weeks of conventional gait training with (experimental group) or without (control group) the inclusion of RAGT. The patients were prospectively evaluated before and after the first treatment session and, after the crossover phase, before and after the second treatment session. The evaluation was based on the 25-foot walk test (25FW, main outcome), 6 min walk test (6MWT), Tinetti Test, Modified Ashworth Scale, and modified Motricity Index for lower limbs. We also measured disability parameters using Functional Independence Measure and Quality of Life Index, and instrumental kinematic and gait parameters: knee extensor strength, double-time support, step length ratio; 17 patients reached the final evaluation. Results: Both groups significantly improved on gait parameters, motor abilities, and autonomy recovery in daily living activities with generally better results of RAGT over control treatment. In particular, the RAGT group improved more than control group in the 25FW (p = 0.004) and the 6MWT (p = 0.022). Conclusions: RAGT is a valid treatment option that in association with physiotherapy could induce positive effects in MS-correlated gait disorders. Our results showed greater effectiveness in recovering gait speed and resistance than conventional gait training.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sconza","given":"Cristiano"},{"family":"Negrini","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Di Matteo","given":"Berardo"},{"family":"Borboni","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Boccia","given":"Gennaro"},{"family":"Petrikonis","given":"Ignas"},{"family":"Stankevičius","given":"Edgaras"},{"family":"Casale","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"sconzaRobotAssistedGaitTraining2021","container-title":"Medicina","container-title-short":"Medicina","DOI":"10.3390/medicina57070713","ISSN":"1648-9144","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,14]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"713","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Robot-Assisted Gait Training in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: A Randomized Controlled Crossover Trial","title-short":"Robot-Assisted Gait Training in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/57/7/713","volume":"57"},{"id":"seanezMotorImprovementsEnabled2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            Electrical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been gaining momentum as a potential therapy for motor paralysis in consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI). Specifically, recent studies combining SCS with activity-based training have reported unprecedented improvements in motor function in people with chronic SCI that persist even without stimulation. In this work, we first provide an overview of the critical scientific advancements that have led to the current uses of SCS in neurorehabilitation: e.g. the understanding that SCS activates dormant spinal circuits below the lesion by recruiting large-to-medium diameter sensory afferents within the posterior roots. We discuss how this led to the standardization of implant position which resulted in consistent observations by independent clinical studies that SCS in combination with physical training promotes improvements in motor performance and neurorecovery. While all reported participants were able to move previously paralyzed limbs from day 1, recovery of more complex motor functions was gradual, and the timeframe for first observations was proportional to the task complexity. Interestingly, individuals with SCI classified as AIS B and C regained motor function in paralyzed joints even without stimulation, but not individuals with motor and sensory complete SCI (AIS A). Experiments in animal models of SCI investigating the potential mechanisms underpinning this neurorecovery suggest a synaptic reorganization of cortico-reticulo-spinal circuits that correlate with improvements in voluntary motor control. Future experiments in humans and animal models of paralysis will be critical to understand the potential and limits for functional improvements in people with different types, levels, timeframes, and severities of SCI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Seáñez","given":"Ismael"},{"family":"Capogrosso","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"seanezMotorImprovementsEnabled2021","container-title":"Bioelectronic Medicine","container-title-short":"Bioelectron Med","DOI":"10.1186/s42234-021-00077-5","ISSN":"2332-8886","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"16","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Motor improvements enabled by spinal cord stimulation combined with physical training after spinal cord injury: review of experimental evidence in animals and humans","title-short":"Motor improvements enabled by spinal cord stimulation combined with physical training after spinal cord injury","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bioelecmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42234-021-00077-5","volume":"7"},{"id":"sebastiaoInteligenciaArtificialNao2020","abstract":"This article analyzes the responses of communications and public relations professionals to European Communication Monitor 2019 questions related to artificial intelligence.

Moreover, adoptive transfer of IL-4/G-CSF polarized BM neutrophils into experimental models of CNS injury triggered substantial axon regeneration within the optic nerve and spinal cord.

Elas ocorrem quando há a interrupção da continuidade das estruturas e do bloqueio da propagação dos impulsos nervosos, afetando a capacidade funcional dos indivíduos. Para avaliar os efeitos dos imunossupressores tacrolimus e ciclosporina na regeneração de nervos periféricos, foi realizada uma revisão sistemática da literatura. Foram incluídos artigos publicados até setembro de 2018, que se propunham avaliar os efeitos dos imunossupressores tacrolimus e ciclosporina na regeneração nervosa e neuroproteção, disponíveis nas bases de dados MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Oxford Pain Relief Database e LILACS. A pesquisa analisou um total de 56 artigos, dos quais 22 foram para metanálise. A análise estatística sugere o efeito protetor do tacrolimus na regeneração do número de axônios mielinizados (intervalo de confiança [IC] 95%: 0,93–2,39; p < 0,01); todavia tal efeito não foi observado em relação à ciclosporina (IC95%: - 0,38–1,18; p = 0,08). Ela também sugere haver uma relação significativa entre o uso do tacrolimus e a espessura da mielina (IC95%: 2,00–5,71; p < 0,01). O uso de imunossupressores na regeneração de lesão nervosa periférica promove um aumento no número de axônios mielinizados de forma geral, independentemente da dose administrada.

It occurs when the continuity of structures is interrupted and the propagation of nervous impulses is blocked, affecting the functional capacity of individuals. To assess the effects of the immunosuppressants tacrolimus and cyclosporine on the regeneration of peripheral nerves, a systematic review of the literature was carried out. The articles included were published until September 2018 and proposed to evaluate the effects of the immunosuppressants tacrolimus and cyclosporine on nerve regeneration and neuroprotection, available in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Oxford Pain Relief Database, and LILACS databases. The research analysed a total of 56 articles, of which 22 were included in the meta-analysis. Statistical analysis suggests the protective effect of tacrolimus in the regeneration of the number of myelinated axons (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93–2.39; p < 0.01); however, such effect was not observed in relation to cyclosporine (95%CI: - 0.38–1.18; p = 0.08) It also suggests that there is a significant relationship between the use of tacrolimus and myelin thickness (95%CI= 2.00–5.71; p < 0. 01). The use of immunosuppressants in the regeneration of peripheral nerve damage promotes an increase in the number of myelinated axons in general, regardless of the administered dose. In addition, it ensures greater myelin thickness, muscle weight and recovery of the sciatic functional index.

It has been suggested that astrocyte performance is progressively impaired with aging, leading to imbalances in the brain’s internal milieu that eventually impact neuronal function and leads to neurodegeneration. Until now most of the evidence of astrocytic dysfunction in aging has come from experiments done with whole tissue homogenates, astrocytes collected by laser capture or cell cultures derived from animal models or cell lines. In this study we used postmortem-derived whole cells sorted with anti-GFAP antibodies to compare the unbiased, whole-transcriptomes of human astrocytes from control, older non-impaired individuals and subjects with different neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (ADD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). We found hundreds of dysregulated genes between disease and control astrocytes. In addition, we identified numerous genes shared between these common neurodegenerative disorders that are similarly dysregulated; in particular, UBC a gene for ubiquitin, which is a protein integral to cellular homeostasis and critically important in regulating function and outcomes of proteins under cellular stress, was upregulated in PSP, PD, and ADD when compared to control.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders Brain and Body Donation Program at Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, Arizona has been supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (U24 NS072026 National Brain and Tissue Resource for Parkinson Disease and Related Disorders), the National Institute on Aging (P30 AG019610 and P30AG072980, Arizona Alzheimer Disease Center), the Arizona Department of Health Services (contract 211002, Arizona Alzheimer Research Center), the Arizona Biomedical Research Commission (contracts 4001, 0011, 05-901 and 1001 to the Arizona Parkinson Disease Consortium) and the Michael J.

Previously, we reported the oral administration of resveratrol nanoparticles (RNs) elicited a neuroprotective effect in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS, at significantly lower doses than unconjugated resveratrol (RSV) due to enhanced bioavailability. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the intranasal administration of a cell-derived secretome-based therapy at low concentrations leads to the selective neuroprotection of the optic nerve in EAE mice. The current study sought to assess the potential selective efficacy of lower concentrations of intranasal RNs for attenuating optic nerve damage in EAE mice. Methods: EAE mice received either a daily intranasal vehicle, RNs or unconjugated resveratrol (RSV) for a period of thirty days beginning on the day of EAE induction. Mice were assessed daily for limb paralysis and weekly for visual function using the optokinetic response (OKR) by observers masked to treatment regimes. After sacrifice at day 30, spinal cords and optic nerves were stained to assess inflammation and demyelination, and retinas were immunostained to quantify retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival. Results: Intranasal RNs significantly increased RGC survival at half the dose previously shown to be required when given orally, reducing the risk of systemic side effects associated with prolonged use. Both intranasal RSV and RN therapies enhanced RGC survival trends, however, only the effects of intranasal RNs were significant. RGC loss was prevented even in the presence of inflammatory and demyelinating changes induced by EAE in optic nerves. Conclusions: The intranasal administration of RNs is able to reduce RGC loss independent of the inflammatory and demyelinating effects on the optic nerve and the spinal cord. The concentration of RNs needed to achieve neuroprotection is lower than previously demonstrated with oral administration, suggesting intranasal drug delivery combined with nanoparticle conjugation warrants further exploration as a potential neuroprotective strategy for the treatment of optic neuritis, alone as well as in combination with glucocorticoids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shamsher","given":"Ehtesham"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Reas S."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Benjamin M."},{"family":"Dine","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Luong","given":"Vy"},{"family":"Cordeiro","given":"M.

Lipid is the main component of myelin and the role of lipid metabolism‐related molecules in myelination attach increasing attention. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) mediates the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to phosphatidylcholine (PC), and its role in myelination draws our interest as LPC is a classical demyelination inducer and PC is a major component of myelin. In this work, LPCAT1 is found expressed in the oligodendrocyte lineage cells during myelination. In vitro experiments showed that the expression level of LPCAT1 gradually increased along with the differentiation process from OPCs to OLs, and over‐expression and interference experiments showed that LPCAT1 promoted OPCs differentiation without affecting their proliferation or apoptosis. Mechanistically, the undertaker of LPCAT1's pro‐differentiation role is not PC, but the phosphorylated mTOR which is a key regulator in OPCs differentiation. RNA sequencing analysis showed LPCAT1 promoted the expression of ZBTB20 which is an important transcription factor related to lipid metabolism and regulates mTOR phosphorylation. In vivo, complex myelin tomacula involving multiple axons was formed after conditionally knocking out LPCAT1 in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, but no obvious myelin thickness abnormalities were observed. Our results indicate that LPCAT1 is an important regulator of myelination, and lipid metabolism‐related molecules may be new valuable targets for the treatment of diseases with myelin abnormalities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shang","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Pu","given":"Yingyan"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Junjian"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Yuchen"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Dingya"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Li"}],"citation-key":"shangLPCAT1EnzymeResponsible2025","container-title":"Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine","container-title-short":"J Cellular Molecular Medi","DOI":"10.1111/jcmm.70387","ISSN":"1582-1838, 1582-4934","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2]]},"language":"en","page":"e70387","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">LPCAT1</span> , the Enzyme Responsible for Converting <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">LPC</span> to <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">PC</span> , Promotes <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">OPC</span> Differentiation In Vitro","title-short":"<span style=\"font-variant","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcmm.70387","volume":"29"},{"id":"shaoJAKInhibitionAmeliorated2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shao","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Chengjuan"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Gaona"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Yazi"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Lan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tiantai"}],"citation-key":"shaoJAKInhibitionAmeliorated2023","container-title":"Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B","container-title-short":"Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B","DOI":"10.1016/j.apsb.2023.07.026","ISSN":"22113835","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10]]},"language":"en","page":"4185-4201","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"JAK inhibition ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by blocking GM-CSF-driven inflammatory signature of monocytes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211383523002897","volume":"13"},{"id":"shaoPinocembrinPromotesOPC2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shao","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Pei","given":"Wenwen"},{"family":"Pu","given":"Yingyan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Mingdong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Weili"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Zhongwang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Kefu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Benqiang"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Li"}],"citation-key":"shaoPinocembrinPromotesOPC2021","container-title":"Neuroscience Bulletin","container-title-short":"Neurosci.

One of the biggest concerns within gene‐based therapy is the delivery of the therapeutic microRNAs to the intended place, which is obligated to surpass the biological barriers without undergoing degradation in the bloodstream or renal excretion. Hence, the delivery of modified and unmodified miRNA molecules using excellent vehicles is required. In this light, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have attracted increasing attention. The MSCs can be genetically modified to express or overexpress a particular microRNA aimed with promote neurogenesis and neuroprotection. The current review has focused on the therapeutic capabilities of microRNAs‐overexpressing MSCs to ameliorate functional deficits in neurological conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shelash Al‐Hawary","given":"Sulieman Ibraheem"},{"family":"Yahya Ali","given":"Anas"},{"family":"Mustafa","given":"Yasser Fakri"},{"family":"Margiana","given":"Ria"},{"family":"Maksuda Ilyasovna","given":"Shamsutdinova"},{"family":"Ramadan","given":"Montather F."},{"family":"Almalki","given":"Sami G."},{"family":"Alwave","given":"Marim"},{"family":"Alkhayyat","given":"Safa"},{"family":"Alsalamy","given":"Ali"}],"citation-key":"shelashal-hawaryMicroRNAsMiRsOverexpressing2023","container-title":"Biotechnology Progress","container-title-short":"Biotechnology Progress","DOI":"10.1002/btpr.3383","ISSN":"8756-7938, 1520-6033","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"language":"en","page":"e3383","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">microRNAs</span> ( <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">miRs</span> ) overexpressing mesenchymal stem cells ( <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">MSCs</span> ) therapy in neurological disorders; hope or hype","title-short":"The <span style=\"font-variant","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/btpr.3383","volume":"39"},{"id":"shenEffectsCFTRENaCSpinal2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Objective\n              To explore the role of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduction regulator (CFTR)-Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in spinal cord edema after spinal cord injury (SCI) and the related mechanism.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated M1830 astrocytes were applied as the SCI\n                in vitro\n                model.

Emerging evidence indicates that the immunomodulatory effect of MSCs is primarily attributed to the paracrine pathway. As one of the key paracrine effectors, mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-EXOs) are small vesicles 30-200 nm in diameter that play an important role in cell-to-cell communication by carrying bioactive substances from parental cells. Recent studies support the finding that MSC-EXOs have an obvious inhibitory effect toward different effector cells involved in the innate and adaptive immune response. Moreover, substantial progress has been made in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type-1 diabetes (T1DM), uveitis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). MSC-EXOs are capable of reproducing MSC function and overcoming the limitations of traditional cell therapy. Therefore, using MSC-EXOs instead of MSCs to treat autoimmune diseases appears to be a promising cell-free treatment strategy. In this review, we review the current understanding of MSC-EXOs and discuss the regulatory role of MSC-EXOs on immune cells and its potential application in autoimmune diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Ziwei"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shengjun"},{"family":"Rui","given":"Ke"}],"citation-key":"shenEffectsMesenchymalStem2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Immunology","container-title-short":"Front.

Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) modeling addresses these limitations by inferring temporal gene expression dynamics while also identifying potential transcriptomic subtypes. Applied to bulk RNA-seq data from post-mortem lumbar spinal cord in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), SuStaIn unraveled that more advanced transcriptomic stages were associated with higher microglia and reduced neuron proportions, which mapped onto two ALS subtypes: Immune/Apoptosis/Proteostasis subtype with early immune/apoptotic/proteostatic dysregulation, worse prognosis and higher microglia proportions; Synapse/RNA-Metabolism subtype with early synaptic/RNA-processing deficits, lower male prevalence and neuron loss. Lumbar patterns demonstrated high concordance with cervical patterns and a strong correlation in staging across regional tissues. These findings revealed subtype-specific mechanisms underlying ALS heterogeneities, prioritized key genes driving subtyping/staging as potential therapeutic targets. More broadly, we established a framework to decode temporal dynamics from traditionally constrained post-mortem transcriptomic studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by NIH funding (P01AG066597, R01NS109260, P30AG072979), Penn Institute on Aging and DeCrane Fund for Primary Progressive Aphasia.

However, quantifying glymphatic function has been challenging. The Diffusion Tensor Imaging Along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) method offers a non-invasive approach to assess glymphatic function by calculating an index that reflects fluid mobility within the brain. This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with the ALPS index and explore its relationships with metabolic, immune, cognitive, and health-related phenotypes.Methods Data from 43,823 participants in the UK Biobank were analyzed. After rigorous quality control, 36,997 individuals with valid bilateral ALPS indices were included. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify genetic loci linked to the ALPS index. The study also explored correlations between the ALPS index and various non-imaging traits, including cognitive performance, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors. Statistical analyses included GWAS, gene enrichment analysis, polygenic risk score validation, Cox regression, and Mendelian randomization.Results The GWAS identified 14 independent loci, encompassing 3,814 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, associated with white matter integrity, brain volume, fiber tract connectivity, inflammation, and metabolism. Key candidate genes, such as GNA12, SERPIND1, and MAPT, were linked to vascular function and neurodegenerative diseases. Enrichment analysis revealed significant roles for neuronal development, signal transduction, and metabolic pathways. The ALPS index showed significant associations with non-imaging phenotypes: higher indices correlated with better physical exercise, cognitive performance, and lower metabolic risks, while negative associations were found with smoking and excessive computer use. Polygenic risk scores confirmed these associations. Further analyses suggested that higher ALPS indices may protect against Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis.Conclusions This study represents the largest genome-wide analysis of the ALPS index to date, revealing key genetic variants that influence glymphatic function and their potential role in neurological health. The ALPS index may serve as a promising biomarker for neurodegenerative disease risk and offers new avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving glymphatic clearance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China to C.S.

This review provides a comprehensive summary of the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic effects of APS in treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). It discusses how APS improve insulin resistance, reduce blood glucose levels, enhance cognitive function, and reduce Aβ accumulation and neuronal apoptosis by modulating various pathways such as Nrf2, JAK/STAT, Toll, and IMD. For PD, APS protect neurons and stabilize mitochondrial function by inhibiting ROS production and promoting autophagy through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. APS also reduce oxidative stress and neurotoxicity induced by 6-hydroxydopamine, showcasing their neuroprotective effects. In MS, APS alleviate symptoms by suppressing T cell proliferation and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression via the PD-1/PD-Ls pathway. APS promote myelin regeneration by activating the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway and fostering the differentiation of neural stem cells into oligodendrocytes. This article emphasizes the significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective pharmacological activities of APS, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shi","given":"Yuanshu"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Ping"}],"citation-key":"shiPharmacologicalEffectsAstragalus2024","container-title":"Frontiers in Pharmacology","container-title-short":"Front.

While there are no cures yet, researchers worldwide are actively working on the development of novel treatments that have the potential to slow disease progression, alleviate symptoms, and ultimately improve the overall health of patients. Huge volumes of new scientific information necessitate new analytical approaches for meaningful hypothesis generation. To enable the automatic analysis of biomedical data we introduced AGATHA, an effective AI-based literature mining tool that can navigate massive scientific literature databases, such as PubMed. The overarching goal of this effort is to adapt AGATHA for drug repurposing by revealing hidden connections between FDA-approved medications and a health condition of interest. Our tool converts the abstracts of peer-reviewed papers from PubMed into multidimensional space where each gene and health condition are represented by specific metrics. We implemented advanced statistical analysis to reveal distinct clusters of scientific terms within the virtual space created using AGATHA-calculated parameters for selected health conditions and genes. Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis was employed for categorizing and predicting samples (122 diseases and 20889 genes) fitted to specific classes. Advanced statistics were employed to build a discrimination model and extract lists of genes specific to each disease class. Here we focus on drugs that can be repurposed for dementia treatment as an outcome of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we determined dementia-associated genes statistically highly ranked in other disease classes. Additionally, we report a mechanism for detecting genes common to multiple health conditions. These sets of genes were classified based on their presence in biological pathways, aiding in selecting candidates and biological processes that are exploitable with drug repurposing.\nAuthor Summary This manuscript outlines our project involving the application of AGATHA, an AI-based literature mining tool, to discover drugs with the potential for repurposing in the context of neurocognitive disorders. The primary objective is to identify connections between approved medications and specific health conditions through advanced statistical analysis, including techniques like Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) and unsupervised clustering. The methodology involves grouping scientific terms related to different health conditions and genes, followed by building discrimination models to extract lists of disease-specific genes. These genes are then analyzed through pathway analysis to select candidates for drug repurposing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Sikirzhytskaya","given":"Aliaksandra"},{"family":"Tyagin","given":"Ilya"},{"family":"Sutton","given":"S.

While disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) offer some relief to people with RRMS, treatment options for progressive MS (pMS) remain frustratingly inadequate. This gap highlights an urgent need for advanced disease modeling techniques to unravel the intricate pathology of pMS. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies and brain organoids are emerging as promising tools for disease modeling in both 2D and 3D in vitro environments. These innovative approaches enable the study of disease mechanisms that closely mimic human pathophysiology and offer new platforms for screening therapeutic compounds, surpassing the limitations of traditional animal models. However, deploying brain organoids in disease modeling presents challenges, especially in the context of non-monogenic disorders.

Infiltrating inflammatory immune cells perpetuate demyelination and axonal damage in the CNS and significantly contribute to pathology and clinical deficits. While the cytokine interferon (IFN)γ is classically described as deleterious in acute CNS autoimmunity, we and others have shown astrocytic IFNγ signaling also has a neuroprotective role. Here, we performed RNA sequencing and ingenuity pathway analysis on IFNγ-treated astrocytes and found that PD-L1 was prominently expressed. Interestingly, PD-1/PD-L1 antagonism reduced apoptosis in leukocytes exposed to IFNγ-treated astrocytes in vitro.

These data support that IFNγ signaling in astrocytes diminishes inflammation during chronic autoimmunity via upregulation of PD-L1, suggesting potential therapeutic benefit for MS patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Brandon C."},{"family":"Tinkey","given":"Rachel A."},{"family":"Brock","given":"Orion D."},{"family":"Mariam","given":"Arshiya"},{"family":"Habean","given":"Maria L."},{"family":"Dutta","given":"Ranjan"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Jessica L."}],"citation-key":"smithAstrocyteInterferongammaSignaling2023","container-title":"Journal of Neuroinflammation","container-title-short":"J Neuroinflammation","DOI":"10.1186/s12974-023-02917-4","ISSN":"1742-2094","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"language":"en","page":"234","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Astrocyte interferon-gamma signaling dampens inflammation during chronic central nervous system autoimmunity via PD-L1","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-023-02917-4","volume":"20"},{"id":"snetselaarlgEfficacyDietFatigue2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidence suggests a role for diet in multiple sclerosis (MS) care; however, owing to methodological issues and heterogeneity of dietary interventions in preliminary trials, the current state of evidence does not support dietary recommendations for MS. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of different dietary approaches on MS-related fatigue and quality of life (QoL) through a systematic review of the literature and network meta-analysis (NMA). METHODS: Electronic database searches were performed in May 2021. Inclusion criteria were (1) randomized trial with a dietary intervention, (2) adults with definitive MS based on McDonald criteria, (3) patient-reported outcomes for fatigue and/or QoL, and (4) minimum intervention period of 4 weeks. For each outcome, standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated and included in random effects NMA to determine the pooled effect of each dietary intervention relative to each of the other dietary interventions. The protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42021262648). RESULTS: Twelve trials comparing 8 dietary interventions (low-fat, Mediterranean, ketogenic, anti-inflammatory, Paleolithic, fasting, calorie restriction, and control [usual diet]), enrolling 608 participants, were included in the primary analysis. The Paleolithic (SMD -1.27; 95% CI -1.81 to -0.74), low-fat (SMD -0.90; 95% CI -1.39 to -0.42), and Mediterranean (SMD -0.89; 95% CI -1.15 to -0.64) diets showed greater reductions in fatigue compared with control. The Paleolithic (SMD 1.01; 95% CI 0.40-1.63) and Mediterranean (SMD 0.47; 95% CI 0.08-0.86) diets showed greater improvements in physical QoL compared with control. For improving mental QoL, the Paleolithic (SMD 0.81; 95% CI 0.26-1.37) and Mediterranean (SMD 0.36; 95% CI 0.06-0.65) diets were more effective compared with control. However, the NutriGRADE credibility of evidence for all direct comparisons is very low because of most of the included trials having high or moderate risk of bias, small sample sizes, and the limited number of studies included in this NMA. DISCUSSION: Several dietary interventions may reduce MS-related fatigue and improve physical and mental QoL; however, because of the limitations of this NMA, which are driven by the low quality of the included trials, these findings must be confirmed in high-quality, randomized, controlled trials.","author":[{"literal":"Snetselaar L G"},{"literal":"Cheek J J"},{"literal":"Fox S S"},{"literal":"Healy H S"},{"literal":"Schweizer M L"},{"literal":"Bao W"},{"literal":"Kamholz J"},{"literal":"Titcomb T J"}],"citation-key":"snetselaarlgEfficacyDietFatigue2023","container-title":"Neurology","DOI":"10.1212/WNL.0000000000201371","ISSN":"0028-3878","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"e357-e366","title":"Efficacy of diet on fatigue and quality of life in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000201371","volume":"100"},{"id":"sniukasWhatStrategy","author":[{"family":"Sniukas","given":"Dr. Marc"}],"citation-key":"sniukasWhatStrategy","container-title":"Entertainment & Humor","page":"27","title":"What is strategy?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.slideshare.net/sniukas/what-is-strategy-1687829>","volume":"13"},{"id":"SocialMediaReach2024","abstract":"Why is social media reach on a downward slope?

A commonly used animal model for this disease is experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Daphnetin (7,8‑dihydroxycoumarin) has been reported to exert various pharmacological activities, such as being neuroprotective and anti‑inflammatory, together with having antioxidant, anticancer, and antiviral properties. Eight‑week‑old C57BL/6 female mice were segregated into 3 groups, namely 1) a control group receiving PBS, 2) a low‑dose treatment group receiving 2 mg/kg of daphnetin, and, 3) a high‑dose treatment group receiving 8 mg/kg of daphnetin. EAE was induced with a subcutaneous injection of a combination of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and complete Freund’s adjuvant. On the day of induction, and again two days later, mice were injected intraperitoneally with pertussis toxin. Histological studies showed low\nlymphocyte infiltration and demyelination in the high and low dose treated groups. The ratio of spleen Treg cells and the levels of IL‑4, IL‑10, TGF‑β, and IL‑33 enhanced significantly in the treatment group related to the control group. Furthermore, both IL‑27 and IL‑35 were also enhanced significantly in the treatment group compared to the control group. Moreover, the levels of IFN‑γ, TNF‑α, and IL‑17 displayed a noticeable reduction in the daphnetin treated group. Daphnetin appears to improve the disease by increasing the expression of anti‑inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors (IL‑4, IL‑10, IL‑33, GATA3, TGF‑β, FoxP3), and reducing the production of pro‑inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors (IFN‑γ, STAT4, T‑bet, IL‑17, STAT3, ROR‑γt, TNF‑α).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Soltanmohammadi","given":"Azita"},{"family":"Tavaf","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Zargarani","given":"Simin"},{"family":"Yazdanpanah","given":"Esmaeil"},{"family":"Sadighi‑Moghaddam","given":"Bizhan"},{"family":"Yousefi","given":"Bahman"},{"family":"Sameni","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Haghmorad","given":"Dariush"}],"citation-key":"soltanmohammadiDaphnetinAlleviatesExperimental2022","container-title":"Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis","container-title-short":"Acta Neurobiol.

Sphingosine 1‐phosphate (S1P) is an essential lipid metabolite that signals through five G‐protein coupled receptors. S1P receptor agonists such as Fingolimod are valuable immunosuppressants used to treat multiple sclerosis, and promote oligodendrocyte survival. However, the role for endogenous S1P, synthesized by the enzyme sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), in oligodendrocyte survival and myelination has not been established. This study investigated the requirement for SphK2 in oligodendrocyte survival and remyelination using the cuprizone mouse model of acute demyelination, followed by spontaneous remyelination. Oligodendrocyte density did not differ between untreated wild‐type (WT) and SphK2 knockout (SphK2\n              −/−\n              ) mice. However, cuprizone treatment caused significantly greater loss of mature oligodendrocytes in SphK2\n              −/−\n              compared to WT mice. Following cuprizone withdrawal, spontaneous remyelination occurred in WT but not SphK2\n              −/−\n              mice, even though progenitor and mature oligodendrocyte density increased in both genotypes. Levels of cytotoxic sphingosine and ceramide were higher in the corpus callosum of SphK2\n              −/−\n              mice, and in contrast to WT mice, did not decline following cuprizone withdrawal in SphK2\n              −/−\n              mice. We also observed a significant reduction in myelin thickness with aging in SphK2\n              −/−\n              compared to WT mice. These results provide the first evidence that SphK2, the dominant enzyme catalyzing S1P synthesis in the adult brain, is essential for remyelination following a demyelinating insult and myelin maintenance with aging. We propose that persistently high levels of sphingosine and ceramide, a direct consequence of SphK2 deficiency, may block remyelination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Song","given":"Huitong"},{"family":"McEwen","given":"Holly P."},{"family":"Duncan","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jun Yup"},{"family":"Teo","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Don","given":"Anthony S."}],"citation-key":"songSphingosineKinase22021","container-title":"Glia","container-title-short":"Glia","DOI":"10.1002/glia.24074","ISSN":"0894-1491, 1098-1136","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"2863-2881","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sphingosine kinase 2 is essential for remyelination following cuprizone intoxication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/glia.24074","volume":"69"},{"id":"sousaantunesMultidisciplinaryPerspectivesArtificial2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,13]]},"citation-key":"sousaantunesMultidisciplinaryPerspectivesArtificial2024","collection-title":"Law, Governance and Technology Series","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-41264-6","editor":[{"family":"Sousa Antunes","given":"Henrique"},{"family":"Freitas","given":"Pedro Miguel"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Arlindo L."},{"family":"Martins Pereira","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Vaz De Sequeira","given":"Elsa"},{"family":"Barreto Xavier","given":"Luís"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-41263-9 978-3-031-41264-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Artificial Intelligence and the Law","type":"book","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-41264-6","volume":"58"},{"id":"spataroIntroducingMicrosoft3652023","abstract":"Humans are hard-wired to dream, to create, to innovate.

These ‘dual action’ compounds (HYCOs) have been designed to mimic the activity of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a stress inducible cytoprotective enzyme that degrades heme to CO which expression is regulated by Nrf2. HYCOs have recently shown efficacy in ameliorating experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanism(s) of action of HYCOs still remains to be fully investigated. Here, we assessed the effects of HYCO-3, a prototype of these hybrids, on myeloid-derived cells, microglial cells and T lymphocytes obtained from EAE-immunized mice. HYCO-3 exerted immunomodulatory effects on all the examined cell populations by inhibiting the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, and downregulating antigen-presenting capacity of these cells. The observed effects support the view that HYCOs are promising candidates to be developed for the treatment of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Stegnjaić","given":"Goran"},{"family":"Nikolovski","given":"Neda"},{"family":"Stanisavljević","given":"Suzana"},{"family":"Lazarević","given":"Milica"},{"family":"Momčilović","given":"Miljana"},{"family":"Foresti","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Motterlini","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Miljković","given":"Đorđe"}],"citation-key":"stegnjaicImmunomodulatoryEffectsHYCO32025","container-title":"Clinical and Experimental Immunology","DOI":"10.1093/cei/uxae100","ISSN":"0009-9104, 1365-2249","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,21]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/pages/standard-publication-reuse-rights","page":"uxae100","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Immunomodulatory effects of HYCO-3, a dual action CO-releaser/Nrf2 activator","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/cei/article/doi/10.1093/cei/uxae100/7900476","volume":"219"},{"id":"stegnjaicPhenethylEsterRosmarinic2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Stegnjaić","given":"Goran"},{"family":"Lazarević","given":"Milica"},{"family":"Diamantis","given":"Dimitrios A."},{"family":"Djedović","given":"Neda"},{"family":"Jevtić","given":"Bojan"},{"family":"Stanisavljević","given":"Suzana"},{"family":"Dimitrijević","given":"Mirjana"},{"family":"Momčilović","given":"Miljana"},{"family":"Tzakos","given":"Andreas G."},{"family":"Miljković","given":"Đorđe"}],"citation-key":"stegnjaicPhenethylEsterRosmarinic2022","container-title":"Immunology Letters","container-title-short":"Immunology Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.imlet.2022.09.006","ISSN":"01652478","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"en","page":"9-19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Phenethyl ester of rosmarinic acid ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165247822001316","volume":"251-252"},{"id":"stekicIntrinsicEcto5Nucleotidase2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Stekic","given":"Andjela"},{"family":"Stevic","given":"Dejan"},{"family":"Dokmanovic","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Anastasov","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Popovic","given":"Danica"},{"family":"Stanojevic","given":"Jelena"},{"family":"Jovanovic","given":"Milica Zeljkovic"},{"family":"Stevanovic","given":"Ivana"},{"family":"Nedeljkovic","given":"Nadezda"},{"family":"Dragic","given":"Milorad"}],"citation-key":"stekicIntrinsicEcto5Nucleotidase2024","container-title":"Molecular Neurobiology","container-title-short":"Mol Neurobiol","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-024-04174-9","ISSN":"0893-7648, 1559-1182","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11]]},"language":"en","page":"9284-9301","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Intrinsic ecto-5'-Nucleotidase/A1R Coupling may Confer Neuroprotection to the Cerebellum in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12035-024-04174-9","volume":"61"},{"id":"stepanovaImprovementGaitBalance2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Stepanova","given":"A."},{"family":"Makshakov","given":"G"},{"family":"Kulyakhtin","given":"A."},{"family":"Kalinin","given":"I."},{"family":"Feys","given":"P"},{"family":"Evdoshenko","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"stepanovaImprovementGaitBalance2022","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2022.103640","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","page":"103640","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Improvement of gait and balance in patients with multiple sclerosis after multidisciplinary physical rehabilitation: Analysis of real-world data in Russia","title-short":"Improvement of gait and balance in patients with multiple sclerosis after multidisciplinary physical rehabilitation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034822001559","volume":"59"},{"id":"steynBenitaSteynStrategy2007","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Steyn","given":"Benita"}],"citation-key":"steynBenitaSteynStrategy2007","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",8,19]]},"language":"en-US","title":"Benita Steyn on Strategy and Public Relations – PR Conversations","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://www.prconversations.com/benita-steyn-on-strategy-and-public-relations/"},{"id":"steynStrategyCorporateCommunication2004","abstract":"Strategic management theory differentiates between enterprise, corporate, business, functional and operational strategy.

Nonetheless, poststroke myelin loss has not been addressed as a therapeutic target, so far. We hypothesized that an antibody‐mediated inhibition of the Nogo receptor‐interacting protein (LINGO‐1, leucine‐rich repeat and immunoglobulin domain‐containing Nogo receptor‐interacting protein) may counteract myelin loss, enhance remyelination and axonal growth, and thus promote functional recovery following stroke. To verify this hypothesis, mice were subjected to photothrombotic stroke and received either an antibody against LINGO‐1 (\n              n\n               = 19) or a control treatment (\n              n\n               = 18). Behavioral tests were performed to assess the effects of anti‐LINGO‐1 treatment on the functional recovery. Seven weeks after stroke, immunohistochemical analyses were performed to analyze the effect of anti‐LINGO‐1 treatment on myelination and axonal loss of corticospinal tract neurons, proliferation of oligodendrocytes and neurogenesis. Anti‐LINGO‐1 treatment resulted in significantly improved functional recovery (\n              p <\n               0.0001, repeated measures analysis of variance), and increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus and subventricular zone of the ipsilateral hemisphere (\n              p\n               = 0.0094 and\n              p\n               = 0.032,\n              t\n              ‐test).

In conclusion, we identified anti‐LINGO‐1 as the first neuroregenerative treatment that counteracts poststroke demyelination of corticospinal tract neurons, presumably by increased proliferation of myelin precursor cells, and thereby improves functional recovery.

Interaction between kynurenine and the AhR is an effector mechanism of immunosuppression. We previously found that the KP is involved in multiple sclerosis (MS) disease progression.

The etiology and pathology of MS remain elusive. However, the role of FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5, also called FKBP51), a newly identified gene associated with MS, in the progression of the disease has not been well defined.

To investigate the mechanism, we discovered that the levels of FKBP5 protein were greatly enhanced in the CNS of cuprizone (CPZ) mice and the myelin-denuded environment stimulates significant activation of the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, in which the important regulator, PPAR-γ, is critically regulated by FKBP5. This study reveals the role of FKBP5 in regulating a dynamic pathway of natural restorative regulation of mitophagy through PPAR-γ in pathological demyelinating settings, which may provide potential targets for the treatment of demyelinating diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Xingzong"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Menghan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Hongliang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yunjie"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Min"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Lili"},{"family":"Bao","given":"Hongkun"}],"citation-key":"sunFKBP5ActivatesMitophagy2023","container-title":"Cell Death & Disease","container-title-short":"Cell Death Dis","DOI":"10.1038/s41419-023-06260-7","ISSN":"2041-4889","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,11]]},"language":"en","page":"736","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"FKBP5 activates mitophagy by ablating PPAR-γ to shape a benign remyelination environment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-023-06260-7","volume":"14"},{"id":"sunHDAC3InhibitorRGFP9662022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Bingyi"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Junrong"},{"family":"Loers","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Siebert","given":"Hans-Christian"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Min"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Xuexing"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhengping"},{"family":"Han","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ruiyan"}],"citation-key":"sunHDAC3InhibitorRGFP9662022","container-title":"ACS Chemical Neuroscience","container-title-short":"ACS Chem.

Ketogenic diet (KD) shows wide neuroprotective effects, but the precise mechanisms underlying the therapeutic activity of KD in MS are unclear. The present study established a continuous 24 days experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model with or without KD. The changes in motor function, pathological hallmarks of EAE, the status of microglia, neuroinflammatory response and intracellular signaling pathways in mice were detected by the rotarod test, histological analysis, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and western blotting. Our results showed that KD could prevent motor deficiency, reduce clinical scores, inhibit demyelination, improve pathological lesions and suppress microglial activation in the spinal cord of EAE mice. Meanwhile, KD shifted microglial polarization toward the protective M2 phenotype and modified the inflammatory milieu by downregulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, as well as upregulating the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β. Furthermore, KD decreased the expression levels of CCL2, CCR2, CCL3, CCR1, CCR5, CXCL10 and CXCR3 in the spinal cord and spleen with reduced monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the CNS.

In a rat model of controlled cortical impact (CCI), we determined that animals supplemented with a nuclear fraction of bovine thymus (TNF) display greatly improved performance on beam balance and spatial memory tests following CCI. Using RNA‐Seq, we identified an array of signaling pathways that are modulated by TNF supplementation in rat hippocampus, including those involved in the process of autophagy. We further show that bovine thymus‐derived extracts contain antigens found in neural tissues and that supplementation of rats with thymus extracts induces production of serum IgG antibodies against neuronal and glial antigens, which may explain the enhanced animal recovery following CCI through possible oral tolerance mechanism. Collectively, our data demonstrate, for the first time, the potency of a nutritional supplement containing nuclear fraction of bovine thymus in enhancing the functional recovery from TBI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Surzenko","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Bastidas","given":"Johana"},{"family":"Reid","given":"Robert W."},{"family":"Curaba","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Bostan","given":"Hamed"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Mickey"},{"family":"Dominique","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Roberson","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Ignacio","given":"Glicerio"},{"family":"Komarnytsky","given":"Slavko"},{"family":"Sanders","given":"Alexa"},{"family":"Lambirth","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Brouwer","given":"Cory R."},{"family":"El‐Khodor","given":"Bassem F."}],"citation-key":"surzenkoFunctionalRecoveryFollowing2024","container-title":"The FASEB Journal","container-title-short":"The FASEB Journal","DOI":"10.1096/fj.202301859R","ISSN":"0892-6638, 1530-6860","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"language":"en","page":"e23460","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Functional recovery following traumatic brain injury in rats is enhanced by oral supplementation with bovine thymus extract","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fj.202301859R","volume":"38"},{"id":"SustentabilidadeEmpresasComo2023","abstract":"A sustentabilidade por parte das empresas deixou de ser uma opção e passou a ser uma obrigatoriedade.

This axonal energy deficiency is associated with impaired electron transport chain function, but also an upstream imbalance of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, with several, including key rate-limiting, enzymes being depleted in neuronal mitochondria in experimental models and in MS lesions. Notably, viral overexpression of individual TCA enzymes can ameliorate the axonal energy deficits in neuroinflammatory lesions, suggesting that TCA cycle dysfunction in MS may be amendable to therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Tai","given":"Yi-Heng"},{"family":"Engels","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Locatelli","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Emmanouilidis","given":"Ioanna"},{"family":"Fecher","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Theodorou","given":"Delphine"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Stephan A."},{"family":"Licht-Mayer","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Kreutzfeldt","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Ingrid"},{"family":"De Mello","given":"Natalia Prudente"},{"family":"Gkotzamani","given":"Sofia-Natsouko"},{"family":"Trovò","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Kendirli","given":"Arek"},{"family":"Aljović","given":"Almir"},{"family":"Breckwoldt","given":"Michael O."},{"family":"Naumann","given":"Ronald"},{"family":"Bareyre","given":"Florence M."},{"family":"Perocchi","given":"Fabiana"},{"family":"Mahad","given":"Don"},{"family":"Merkler","given":"Doron"},{"family":"Lichtenthaler","given":"Stefan F."},{"family":"Kerschensteiner","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Misgeld","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"taiTargetingTCACycle2023","container-title":"Nature Metabolism","container-title-short":"Nat Metab","DOI":"10.1038/s42255-023-00838-3","ISSN":"2522-5812","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1364-1381","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Targeting the TCA cycle can ameliorate widespread axonal energy deficiency in neuroinflammatory lesions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00838-3","volume":"5"},{"id":"tanakaCeramideKinaseKnockout2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Ai"},{"family":"Anada","given":"Kohei"},{"family":"Yasue","given":"Masataka"},{"family":"Honda","given":"Takuya"},{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Murayama","given":"Toshihiko"}],"citation-key":"tanakaCeramideKinaseKnockout2022","container-title":"Life Sciences","container-title-short":"Life Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.lfs.2022.120446","ISSN":"00243205","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"language":"en","page":"120446","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ceramide kinase knockout ameliorates multiple sclerosis-like behaviors and demyelination in cuprizone-treated mice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0024320522001461","volume":"296"},{"id":"tanohMSCopilotNewSmartphonebased2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Tanoh","given":"Ian-Christopher"},{"family":"Maillart","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Labauge","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Mikael"},{"family":"Maarouf","given":"Adil"},{"family":"Vukusic","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Donzé","given":"Cécile"},{"family":"Gallien","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"De Sèze","given":"Jérôme"},{"family":"Bourre","given":"Bertrand"},{"family":"Moreau","given":"Thibault"},{"family":"Louapre","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Vallée","given":"Morgane"},{"family":"Bieuvelet","given":"Séverine"},{"family":"Klaeylé","given":"Lissandra"},{"family":"Argoud","given":"Anne-Laure"},{"family":"Zinaï","given":"Saad"},{"family":"Tourbah","given":"Ayman"}],"citation-key":"tanohMSCopilotNewSmartphonebased2021","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2021.103164","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"language":"en","page":"103164","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"MSCopilot: New smartphone-based digital biomarkers correlate with Expanded Disability Status Scale scores in people with Multiple Sclerosis","title-short":"MSCopilot","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034821004314","volume":"55"},{"id":"tareenCarvacrolEssentialOil2024","abstract":"Neurodegenerative diseases were mostly perceived as diseases of ageing populations, but now-a-days, these diseases pose a threat to populations of all age groups despite significant improvements in quality of life. Almost all essential oils (EOs) have been reported to have some neuroprotective abilities and have been used as supplements for good mental health over the centuries. This review highlights the therapeutic potential of one such monoterpene phenolic EO, carvacrol (CV), that has the potential to be used as a main therapeutic intervention for neurodegenerative disorders. Three libraries, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, were explored for research studies related to the neuroprotective roles of CV. All the research articles from these libraries were sorted out, with the first article tracing back to 2009, and the latest article was published in 2024. The positive effects of CV in the treatment of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases, multiple sclerosis, ischemia, and behavioural disorders have been supported with evidence. This review not only focused on study designs and the pharmacological pathways taken by CV for neuroprotection but also focused on demographics, illustrating the trend of CV research studies in certain countries and the preferences for the use of in vitro or in vivo models in studies. Our review provides useful evidence about the neuroprotective potential of CV; however, a lack of studies was observed regarding CV encapsulation in proper dosage forms, in particular nanoparticles, which could be further explored for CV delivery to the central nervous system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Tareen","given":"Fahad Khan"},{"family":"Catenacci","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Perteghella","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Sorrenti","given":"Milena"},{"family":"Bonferoni","given":"Maria Cristina"}],"citation-key":"tareenCarvacrolEssentialOil2024","container-title":"Molecules","container-title-short":"Molecules","DOI":"10.3390/molecules30010104","ISSN":"1420-3049","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,30]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"104","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Carvacrol Essential Oil as a Neuroprotective Agent: A Review of the Study Designs and Recent Advances","title-short":"Carvacrol Essential Oil as a Neuroprotective Agent","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/1/104","volume":"30"},{"id":"taskinFactorXITherapeutic2024","abstract":"Purpose of review\n              This review summarizes the pathophysiology and potential therapeutic options for treatment of multiple sclerosis, a common neuronal demyelinating disorder affecting 2.2 million people worldwide. As an autoimmune disorder, multiple sclerosis is associated with neuroinflammation and increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), although the cause linking multiple sclerosis with compromised barrier function remains ill-defined. It has been previously shown that coagulation factors, including thrombin and fibrin, exacerbate the inflammatory processes and permeability of the BBB.\n            \n            \n              Recent findings\n              Increased levels of the coagulation factor (F) XII have been found in patients presenting with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis, with a deleterious role for FXII being validated in murine model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Recent work has uncovered a role for the major substrate activated by FXII and thrombin, FXI, in the disorder of EAE. The study found that pharmacological targeting of FXI decreased clinical symptoms, lymphocyte invasion, and white matter destruction in a multiple sclerosis model.\n            \n            \n              Summary\n              This review emphasizes the role of FXII and FXI in regulating barrier function and the immune response in neuroinflammation.

Here, we used multi-organ imaging (N=105,433), individual- and summary-level genetics, and proteomics (N=53,940) from the UK Biobank, Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, FinnGen, and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium to delineate a brain-heart-eye axis via 2003 brain patterns of structural covariance1 (PSC), 82 heart imaging-derived phenotypes2 (IDP) and 84 eye IDPs3–5. Cross-organ phenotypic associations highlight the central autonomic network between the brain and heart and the central visual pathway between the brain and eye. Proteome-wide associations of the PSCs and IDPs show both within-organ specificity and cross-organ interconnections, verified by the RNA and protein expression profiles of the 2923 plasma proteins. Pleiotropic effects of common genetic variants are observed across multiple organs, and key genetic parameters, such as SNP-based heritability, polygenicity, and selection signatures, are comparatively evaluated among the three organs. A gene-drug-disease network shows the potential of drug repurposing for cross-organ diseases. Colocalization and causal analyses reveal cross-organ causal relationships between PSC/IDP and chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, heart failure, and glaucoma. Finally, integrating multi-organ/omics features improves prediction for systemic disease categories and cognition compared to single-organ/omics features. This study depicts a detailed brain-heart-eye axis and highlights future avenues for modeling human aging and disease across multiple scales.

Antioxidant compounds are gaining interest towards the manipulation of MS, since they offer, in most of the cases, many benefits, due to their pleiotropical activity, that mainly derives from the oxidative stress decrease. This review analyzes research articles, of the last decade, which describe biological in vitro, in vivo and clinical evaluation of various categories of the most therapeutically applied natural antioxidant compounds, and some of their derivatives, with anti-MS activity. It also summarizes some of the main characteristics of MS and the role the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species may have in its progression, as well as their relation with the other mechanistic aspects of the disease, in order for the multi-targeting potential of those antioxidants to be defined and the source of origination of such activity explained. Antioxidant compounds with specific characteristics are expected to affect positively some aspects of the disease, and their potential may render them as effective candidates for neurological impairment reduction in combination with the MS treatment regimen.

Lesion development in MS is associated with increased expression of FGF1, FGF2 and FGF9, all of which modulate remyelination in a variety of experimental settings. However, FGF9 is also selectively upregulated in major depressive disorder (MDD), prompting us to speculate it may also have a direct effect on neuronal function and survival.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Transcriptional profiling of myelinating cultures treated with FGF1, FGF2 or FGF9 was performed, and the effects of FGF9 on cortical neurons investigated using a combination of transcriptional, electrophysiological and immunofluorescence microscopic techniques.

This was associated with a complete block in the development of photo‐inducible spiking activity, as demonstrated using multi‐electrode recordings of channel rhodopsin‐transfected rat cortical neurons in vitro and, ultimately, neuronal cell death. Overexpression of FGF9 in vivo resulted in rapid loss of neurons and subsequent development of chronic grey matter lesions with neuroaxonal reduction and ensuing myelin loss.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              These observations identify overexpression of FGF9 as a mechanism by which neuroaxonal pathology could develop independently of immune‐mediated demyelination in MS.

This study integrates multi-omics data with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods to uncover the molecular basis underlying AD phenotype regulation and explore personalized drug repositioning strategies based on individual genetic backgrounds. First, we applied the PrediXcan method to identify candidate genes closely associated with AD cognitive diagnosis, selecting from 61 brain-related traits. We validated these findings through individual-level analysis using gene expression and genotype data from 553 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples in the ROSMAP database. Simultaneously, we constructed a deep, multi-layer information fusion model (AD-MIF) by integrating genotype and gene expression data and employing autoencoders as well as graph autoencoders for multi-modal feature extraction. The results revealed a 10–20% improvement in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for predicting AD-related phenotypes. Both approaches showed high consistency across cellular structures, brain regions, and neurobiological pathways, demonstrating their complementary advantages. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that APOE and its interacting gene APOC1 play a central role in cholesterol metabolism, lipid transport, and immune regulation, while genes such as SCIMP and KAT8 are involved in immune signaling, epigenetic regulation, and neuroprotection. After incorporating attention mechanisms, AD-MIF highlighted the importance of key genes, such as POLR2C and TRAPPC4, in regulating neuronal function. Based on predictive results and enrichment analysis, we further identified candidate drugs, including sirolimus, dasatinib, and MGCD-265. In vivo experiments confirmed that MGCD-265, also known as Glesatinib, and dasatinib significantly improve cognitive deficits in the SAMP8 AD model mice by inhibiting neuroinflammation, pathological tau phosphorylation, and Aβ deposition. This study demonstrates the complementary advantages of bioinformatics pipelines and AI-based multi-modal fusion methods in elucidating the complex pathological mechanisms of AD and enhancing phenotype prediction accuracy. It also provides new theoretical support for personalized drug interventions based on individual genetic characteristics, laying a solid foundation for optimizing early screening, prediction, and personalized treatment strategies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

The ideal MS therapy would both specifically inhibit the underlying autoimmune response and promote repair/regeneration of myelin as well as maintenance of axonal integrity. Currently approved MS therapies consist of non‐specific immunosuppressive molecules/antibodies which block activation or CNS homing of autoreactive T cells, but there are no approved therapies for stimulation of remyelination nor maintenance of axonal integrity. In an effort to repurpose an FDA‐approved medication for myelin repair, we chose to examine the effectiveness of digoxin, a cardiac glycoside (Na\n              +\n              /K\n              +\n              ATPase inhibitor), originally identified as pro‐myelinating in an in vitro screen.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and tolerability of medicinal cannabinoids compared with placebo in the symptomatic treatment of patients with MS. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library Plus up to July 26, 2016. No restrictions were applied. The search was completed with information from ClinicalTrials.gov. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trials evaluating the effect of medicinal cannabinoids by oral or oromucosal route of administration on the symptoms of spasticity, pain, or bladder dysfunction in adult patients with MS. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines were followed. Effect sizes were calculated as standardized mean difference (SMD) for efficacy, and rate ratio (RR) for tolerability. Within each study, those SMDs evaluating the same outcome were combined before the meta-analysis to obtain a single value per outcome and study. Pooling of the studies was performed on an intention-to-treat basis by means of random-effect meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Spasticity (on the Ashworth and Modified Ashworth scales and subjective), pain, bladder dysfunction, adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. RESULTS: Seventeen selected trials including 3161 patients were analyzed. Significant findings for the efficacy of cannabinoids vs placebo were SMD = -0.25 SD (95% CI, -0.38 to -0.13 SD) for spasticity (subjective patient assessment data), -0.17 SD (95% CI, -0.31 to -0.03 SD) for pain, and -0.11 SD (95% CI, -0.22 to -0.0008 SD) for bladder dysfunction. Results favored cannabinoids. Findings for tolerability were RR = 1.72 patient-years (95% CI, 1.46-2.02 patient-years) in the total adverse events analysis and 2.95 patient-years (95% CI, 2.14-4.07 patient-years) in withdrawals due to adverse events. Results described a higher risk for cannabinoids. The serious adverse events meta-analysis showed no statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results suggest a limited efficacy of cannabinoids for the treatment of spasticity, pain, and bladder dysfunction in patients with MS. Therapy using these drugs can be considered as safe.

Hence, new pharmacological interventions that drive anti-inflammatory activity and neuroprotection would represent interesting alternative therapeutic approaches or complementary strategies to treat progressive forms of MS. There is evidence of reduced noradrenaline levels and alterations to locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons in MS patients, as well as in animal models of this disease, potentially factors contributing to the pathophysiology. Drugs that enhance noradrenaline appear to have some beneficial effects in MS, suggesting their potential to dampen the underlying pathology and disease progression.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Therefore, we explored the consequences of chronic LC noradrenergic neurons activation by chemogenetics in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice, the most widely used experimental model of MS. LC activation from the onset or the peak of motor symptoms was explored as two different therapeutic approaches, assessing the motor and non-motor behavioral changes as EAE progresses, and studying demyelination, inflammation and glial activation in the spinal cord and cerebral cortex during the chronic phase of EAE.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              LC activation from the onset of motor symptoms markedly alleviated the motor deficits in EAE mice, as well as their anxiety-like behavior and sickness, in conjunction with reduced demyelination and perivascular infiltration in the spinal cord and glial activation in the spinal cord and prefrontal cortex (PFC). When animals exhibited severe paralysis, LC activation produced a modest alleviation of EAE motor symptoms and it enhanced animal well-being, in association with an improvement of the EAE pathology at the spinal cord and PFC level. Interestingly, the reduced dopamine beta-hydroxylase expression associated with EAE in the spinal cord and PFC was reversed through chemogenetic LC activation.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              Therefore, clear anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects were produced by the selective activation of LC noradrenergic neurons in EAE mice, having greater benefits when LC activation commenced earlier. Overall, these data suggest noradrenergic LC neurons may be targets to potentially alleviate some of the motor and non-motor symptoms in MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Torrillas-de La Cal","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Torres-Sanchez","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"Bravo","given":"Lidia"},{"family":"Llorca-Torralba","given":"Meritxell"},{"family":"Garcia-Partida","given":"Jose Antonio"},{"family":"Arroba","given":"Ana I."},{"family":"Berrocoso","given":"Esther"}],"citation-key":"torrillas-delacalChemogeneticActivationLocus2023","container-title":"Journal of Neuroinflammation","container-title-short":"J Neuroinflammation","DOI":"10.1186/s12974-023-02865-z","ISSN":"1742-2094","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"198","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chemogenetic activation of locus coeruleus neurons ameliorates the severity of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-023-02865-z","volume":"20"},{"id":"tothRoleEndocrinePACAP2023","abstract":"Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a conserved neuropeptide, which confers diverse anti-aging endocrine and paracrine/autocrine effects, including anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action.

OBJECTIVE: To confirm the efficacy and safety of MD1003 in progressive MS in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. METHODS: Patients (n = 154) with a baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4.5-7 and evidence of disease worsening within the previous 2 years were randomised to 12-month MD1003 (100 mg biotin) or placebo thrice daily, followed by 12-month MD1003 for all patients. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with disability reversal at month 9, confirmed at month 12, defined as an EDSS decrease of ⩾1 point (⩾0.5 for EDSS 6-7) or a ⩾20% decrease in timed 25-foot walk time compared with the best baseline among screening or randomisation visits. RESULTS: A total of 13 (12.6%) MD1003-treated patients achieved the primary endpoint versus none of the placebo-treated patients (p = 0.005). MD1003 treatment also reduced EDSS progression and improved clinical impression of change compared with placebo. Efficacy was maintained over follow-up, and the safety profile of MD1003 was similar to that of placebo. CONCLUSION: MD1003 achieves sustained reversal of MS-related disability in a subset of patients with progressive MS and is well tolerated.","author":[{"literal":"Tourbah A"},{"literal":"Lebrun-Frenay C"},{"literal":"Edan G"},{"literal":"Clanet M"},{"literal":"Papeix C"},{"literal":"Vukusic S"},{"literal":"De Sèze J"},{"literal":"Debouverie M"},{"literal":"Gout O"},{"literal":"Clavelou P"},{"literal":"Defer G"},{"literal":"Laplaud D A"},{"literal":"Moreau T"},{"literal":"Labauge P"},{"literal":"Brochet B"},{"literal":"Sedel F"},{"literal":"Pelletier J"}],"citation-key":"tourbahaMD1003HighdoseBiotin2016","container-title":"Mult Scler","DOI":"10.1177/1352458516667568","ISSN":"1352-4585 (Print) 1352-4585","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1719-1731","title":"MD1003 (high-dose biotin) for the treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458516667568","volume":"22"},{"id":"tourbahEffectMD1003High2015","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Tourbah","given":"Ayman"},{"family":"Lebrun Frenay","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Edan","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Clanet","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Papeix","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Vukusic","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"De Seze","given":"Jerome"},{"family":"Debouverie","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Gout","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Clavelou","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Defer","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Laplaud","given":"David"},{"family":"Moreau","given":"Thibault"},{"family":"Labauge","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Brochet","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Sedel","given":"Frederic"},{"family":"Pelletier","given":"Jean"}],"citation-key":"tourbahEffectMD1003High2015","container-title":"Neurology","container-title-short":"Neurology","DOI":"10.1212/WNL.84.14_supplement.PL2.002","ISSN":"0028-3878, 1526-632X","issue":"14_supplement","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,6]]},"language":"en","page":"PL2.002","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect of MD1003 (High Doses of Biotin) in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: Results of a Pivotal Phase III Randomized Double Blind Placebo Controlled Study (PL2.002)","title-short":"Effect of MD1003 (High Doses of Biotin) in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.84.14_supplement.PL2.002","volume":"84"},{"id":"tovarAILiteratureReview2023","abstract":"The process of conducting literature reviews is often time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Few studies have examined the spatial expression of chitinase expressing cells with respect to neuropathologic hallmarks of disease.Methods RNA-sequencing was used to examine Chit-1 and CHI3L1 gene expression in the spinal cord and motor cortex. Immunohistochemistry was used to characterize the distribution of Chit-1 and CHI3L1 expressing cells in ALS, C9-ALS, FTLD, AD, and non-neurologic disease controls. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to correlate distribution of Chit-1 and CHI3L1 expressing cells to TDP pathology.Results Chit-1 gene expression was increased in the spinal cord, and CHI3L1 expression was increased in both the spinal cord and motor cortex of sALS and C9-ALS patients when compared to controls. Highest levels of Chit-1+ glia were in cortical regions that contain hallmark neuropathology for each neurodegenerative disease. CHI3L1+ glia were only significantly increased in sALS. Neither Chit-1+ nor CHI3L1+ glia were in close proximity to pTDP containing neurons in the motor cortex gray matter; however, there was a significant co-localization of glial pTDP with Chit-1 and CHI3L1 in the motor cortex white matter.Conclusions Chit-1 and CHI3L1 expressing cells were most abundant in the white matter of cortical regions affected by each neurodegenerative disease and the spinal cord. Chit-1 or CHI3L1 expressing cells in the white matter also contained phosphorylated TDP-43. We also observed correlations between levels of Chit-1 or CHI3L1 expressing cells in the white matter to disease duration.What is already known on this topic Prior studies identified elevated levels of Chit-1 and CHI3L1 proteins in the CSF of various neurodegenerative conditions, though few studies examined levels of Chit-1 and CHI3L1 expressing cells both spatially and in relation to disease pathology.What this study adds We performed an extensive spatial characterization of Chit-1 and CHI3L1 protein levels across multiple regions and neurodegenerative conditions. This study also correlates Chit-1 and CHI3L1 expression to TDP pathology and other clinical parameters of disease duration.How this study might affect research, practice or policy Our findings indicate that the majority of Chit-1 and CHI3L1 expressing glia are located in the cortical subpial layer and the white matter, suggesting a role for chitinases in modulating neuroinflammatory mechanisms or reparative/regenerative responses in the white matter of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants associated with brain phenotypes, but their interpretation is complicated by polygenicity and pleiotropy. To address this, we applied genomICA, a data-driven multivariate method, to GWAS summary statistics of thousands of MRI-derived brain phenotypes from 33,224 UK Biobank participants. genomICA decomposes high-dimensional genetic data into independent components (ICs), capturing shared patterns of genetic influence across multiple traits. We identified 16 ICs, collectively explaining 39.2% of the variance. We describe each IC in detail here and in an online database (genomica.info). In addition to IC-brain and IC-genomic loadings, we explored the IC’s biological underpinnings through gene set enrichment and trait association analyses. Our results revealed that the generated components highlighted a diversity of neurobiological processes such as stress response (IC2), inflammation (IC5, IC15), glutamatergic signaling (IC8), lipid and semaphorin pathways (IC10), and circadian rhythms (IC12). In addition, some components reflect complex behavioral/lifestyle aspects such as diet and risk taking. genomICA offers a novel, data-driven framework for dissecting the complex genetic architecture of brain phenotypes, moving beyond univariate GWAS. This exploratory study provides a valuable resource for the imaging and genetic community, with all components and associated data available at genomICA.info, serving as a starting point for hypothesis generation and downstream analyses in brain health and disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunded by the European Union, the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) and the UK Researchand Innovation (UKRI) under the UK government HorizonEurope funding guarantee (Grant Agreement No 101057529).

Nearly, 85% of MS cases start with attacks and remissions, classified as relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). With repeating attacks, MS causes brain-spinal cord atrophy and enhanced disability as disease progresses. PLP-induced EAE is one of the most established models for pathophysiology and treatment of RRMS. Recent studies demonstrated the possible role of pericytes in perivascular and intra-lesional fibrosis in PLP-induced EAE, whose importance remains elusive. Hence, we have investigated the possible role of pericytes in fibrosis formation and amelioration with a hemichannel blocker, Carbenoxolone (CBX).\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              PLP-induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model is used and the effect of CBX is investigated. Clinical scores were recorded and followed. Perivascular Collagen 1 and 3 accumulations were demonstrated as markers of fibrosis in the spinal cord. To delineate the role of pericytes, human brain vascular pericytes (HBVP) were incubated with the sera of MS patients to induce in-vitro MS model and the fibrosis formation was investigated.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In the PLP induced in-vivo model, both intracerebroventricular and intraperitoneal CBX have significantly mitigated the disease progression followed by clinical scores, demyelination, and fibrosis.

Previous reports have shown that excessive oxidative stress, related to mitochondrial dysfunction and the accumulation of misfolding protein, contributes to ALS pathology. In terms of treatment, it remains necessary to identify effective medicines for multiple therapeutic targets and have additive effects against several disorders. In this study, we investigated stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED), which release many factors, such as neurotrophic factors and cytokines, and are applied to treat neurological diseases. Specifically, we examined whether SHED-conditioned medium (CM), i.e., the serum-free culture supernatant of SHED, reduced mutant SOD1-induced intracellular aggregates and neurotoxicity. We found that SHED-CM significantly suppressed the mutant SOD1-induced intracellular aggregates and neurotoxicity. The neuroprotective effects of SHED-CM are partly related to heat shock protein and the activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor. SHED-CM also had a protective effect on induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons. Moreover, SHED-CM was effective against not only familial ALS but also sporadic ALS. Overall, these results suggest that SHED-CM could be a promising treatment for slowing the progression of ALS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ueda","given":"Tomoyuki"},{"family":"Ito","given":"Taisei"},{"family":"Inden","given":"Masatoshi"},{"family":"Kurita","given":"Hisaka"},{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Akihito"},{"family":"Hozumi","given":"Isao"}],"citation-key":"uedaStemCellsHuman2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Pharmacology","container-title-short":"Front.

The objective of this study was therefore to assess the long-term impact of Sativex on cognitive function and mood in MS patients with spasticity. METHODS: 121 patients were randomly assigned Sativex or placebo in a double-blind manner. Patients selfadministered treatment daily for 48 weeks while maintaining anti-spasticity therapy. The primary endpoint was the difference between treatments in Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) score from baseline to end of treatment. Secondary measures included Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Subject-, Physician- and Caregiver Global Impression of Change, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. RESULTS: 62 patients were randomised to Sativex and 59 to placebo. There was no difference in the effect of Sativex on PASAT and BDI-II scores compared with placebo. Subject-, Physician- and Caregiver-rated improvements in spasticity with Sativex were all statistically significant. The mean daily dose of Sativex declined gradually to 6.4 sprays per day. CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with Sativex was not associated with cognitive decline or significant changes in mood in this prone population sample. Sativex was efficacious and well tolerated across the study period and no new safety concerns were identified.","author":[{"literal":"Vachová M"},{"literal":"Novotná A"},{"literal":"Mares J"},{"literal":"Taláb R"},{"literal":"Fiedler J"},{"literal":"Lauder H"},{"literal":"Taylor L"},{"literal":"Etges T"},{"literal":"Wright S"},{"literal":"Nováková I"}],"citation-key":"vachovamMulticentreDoubleblindRandomised2014","container-title":"Journal of Multiple Sclerosis","DOI":"10.4172/2376-0389.1000122","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"122","title":"A multicentre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study of effect of long-term Sativex® treatment on cognition and mood of patients with spasticity due to multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/954c/55f9f6c67ce9e8f91a30281fb9a14ce2825d.pdf (DOI: 10.4172/2376-0389.1000122)","volume":"1"},{"id":"vaerenberghSteven2358Awesomegenerativeai2024","abstract":"A curated list of modern Generative Artificial Intelligence projects and services","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaerenbergh","given":"Steven Van"}],"citation-key":"vaerenberghSteven2358Awesomegenerativeai2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,26]]},"license":"CC0-1.0","original-date":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,20]]},"source":"GitHub","title":"steven2358/awesome-generative-ai","type":"software","URL":"https://github.com/steven2358/awesome-generative-ai"},{"id":"vafaei-nezhadTherapeuticEffectsPhotobiomodulation2022","abstract":"Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the autoimmune and chronic diseases of the central nervous system; this disease occurs more frequently in young people and women and leads to neurological symptoms. Oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, and oligodendrocyte dysfunction have a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of this disease. Nowadays it is reported that photobiomodulation (PBM) as a non-invasive treatment has neuroprotective potential, but the exact mechanisms are not understood. Methods: In this study, we reviewed the effects of PBM on MS. In this regard, we used the keywords \"Photobiomodulation\", \"Laser therapy\", and \"Low-level laser therapy\" on MS to find related studies on this subject in PubMed, Google scholar, Elsevier, Medline, and Scopus databases. Results: PBM has positive effects on MS by regulating the inflammatory process, controlling immune cell activity and mitochondrial functions, as well as inhibiting free radicals production which finally leads to a reduction in neurological defects and an improvement in the functional status of patients.

Disease progression, while slowed, still occurs with time. Increasing the impact of the treatment while decreasing the frequency of injections would be ideal. The mechanism of action of GA remains undefined. We developed an alternate approach, KGYY6, whose mechanism of action targets the CD40 receptor with promising results in an Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Methods: GA and a CD40-targeting peptide, KGYY6, were formulated as slow-release particles used to treat EAE in C57BL/6 mice. Results: Compared to liquid formulations, the particle formulations vastly improved drug efficacy in both cases, which would be advantageous in treating MS. GA is a combination of randomly generated peptides, in the size range of 5000–9000 Da, using the amino acids E, A, Y, and K. This approach introduces batch differences that impacts efficacy, a persistent problem with GA. KGYY6 is generated in a controlled process and has a motif, K-YY, which could be generated when manufacturing GA. When testing two different lots of GA or KGYY6, the latter performed equally well across lots, while GA did not. Conclusions: Slow-release formulations of both GA and KGYY6 vastly improve the efficacy of both, and KGYY6 is more consistent in efficacy across different lots.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaitaitis","given":"Gisela M."},{"family":"Wagner","given":"David H."}],"citation-key":"vaitaitisSlowSubcutaneousRelease2024","container-title":"Neurology International","container-title-short":"Neurology International","DOI":"10.3390/neurolint16060114","ISSN":"2035-8377","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,20]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1540-1551","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Slow Subcutaneous Release of Glatiramer Acetate or CD40-Targeting Peptide KGYY6 Is More Advantageous in Treating Ongoing Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2035-8377/16/6/114","volume":"16"},{"id":"vale-silvaRhoARegulatesOligodendrocyte2025","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Timely differentiation and myelin formation by oligodendrocytes are essential for the physiological functioning of the central nervous system (CNS).

In the past, we have shown that mast cells (MCs) improve the functional outcome after SCI by suppressing scar tissue formation at the lesion site via mouse mast cell protease 6 (mMCP6). In this study, we investigated whether recombinant mMCP6 can be used therapeutically to improve the functional outcome after SCI. Therefore, we applied mMCP6 locally via an intrathecal catheter in the subacute phase after a spinal cord hemisection injury in mice. Our findings showed that hind limb motor function was significantly improved in mice that received recombinant mMCP6 compared with the vehicle‐treated group. In contrast to our previous findings in mMCP6 knockout mice, the lesion size and expression levels of the scar components fibronectin, laminin, and axon‐growth‐inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were not affected by the treatment with recombinant mMCP6. Surprisingly, no difference in infiltration of CD4+ T cells and reactivity of Iba‐1+ microglia/macrophages at the lesion site was observed between the mMCP6‐treated mice and control mice. Additionally, local protein levels of the pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory mediators IL‐1β, IL‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10, TNF‐α, IFNγ, and MCP‐1 were comparable between the two treatment groups, indicating that locally applied mMCP6 did not affect inflammatory processes after injury. However, the increase in locomotor performance in mMCP6‐treated mice was accompanied by reduced demyelination and astrogliosis in the perilesional area after SCI. Consistently, we found that TNF‐α/IL‐1β‐astrocyte activation was decreased and that oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation was increased after recombinant mMCP6 treatment in vitro. Mechanistically, this suggests effects of mMCP6 on reducing astrogliosis and improving (re)myelination in the spinal cord after injury. In conclusion, these data show for the first time that recombinant mMCP6 is therapeutically active in enhancing recovery after SCI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Vangansewinkel","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Lemmens","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Tiane","given":"Assia"},{"family":"Geurts","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Dooley","given":"Dearbhaile"},{"family":"Vanmierlo","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Pejler","given":"Gunnar"},{"family":"Hendrix","given":"Sven"}],"citation-key":"vangansewinkelTherapeuticAdministrationMouse2023","container-title":"The FASEB Journal","container-title-short":"The FASEB Journal","DOI":"10.1096/fj.202201942RR","ISSN":"0892-6638, 1530-6860","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6]]},"language":"en","page":"e22939","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Therapeutic administration of mouse mast cell protease 6 improves functional recovery after traumatic spinal cord injury in mice by promoting remyelination and reducing glial scar formation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fj.202201942RR","volume":"37"},{"id":"vanlieropOcrelizumabNatalizumabJCvirus2021","abstract":"Ocrelizumab is often used as an alternative therapy in natalizumab-treated MS patients at risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

This process is not necessarily two-way but omnidirectional diachronic, with an emphasis on the external and internal arenas of continuous meaning presentations, negotiations, and constructions.

The physical properties are sensed by the cells through mechanoreceptors and translated into ion currents which activate multiple biochemical cascades allowing the cells to adapt and respond to changes in their microenvironment. Piezo1 is one of the first identified mechanoreceptors. It modulates various central nervous system functions such as axonal growth or activation of astrocytes. Piezo1 signaling was also shown to play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we explore the expression of the mechanoreceptor Piezo1 in human MO3.13 oligodendrocytes and human MS/non-MS patients’ brains and investigate its putative effects on oligodendrocyte proliferation, maturation, and migration. We found that Piezo1 is expressed in human oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the human brain and that its inhibition with GsMTx4 leads to an increment in proliferation and migration of MO3.13 oligodendrocytes. Activation of Piezo1 with Yoda-1 induced opposite effects. Further, we observed that expression of Piezo1 decreased with MO3.13 maturation\n              in vitro\n              . Differences in expression were also observed between healthy and multiple sclerosis brains. Remarkably, the data showed significantly lower expression of Piezo1 in the white matter in multiple sclerosis brains compared to its expression in the white matter in healthy controls. There were no differences in Piezo1 expression between the white matter plaque and healthy-appearing white matter in the multiple sclerosis brain. Taken together, we here show that Piezo1-induced signaling can be used to modulate oligodendrocyte function and that it may be an important player in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Velasco-Estevez","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Koch","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Klejbor","given":"Ilona"},{"family":"Caratis","given":"Fionä"},{"family":"Rutkowska","given":"Aleksandra"}],"citation-key":"velasco-estevezMechanoreceptorPiezo1Downregulated2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

Endothelial cell dysfunction leading to increased permeability and compromised barrier function are hallmarks of neuroinflammatory and autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Therapeutic strategies that improve or protect endothelial barrier function may be beneficial in the treatment or prevention of neuroinflammatory diseases. We therefore tested the hypothesis that biasing thrombin toward anticoagulant and cytoprotective activities would provide equivalent or even additive benefit compared with standard-of-care therapeutic strategies, including corticosteroids. In a mouse model of relapsing-remitting MS, treatment with the thrombin mutant, E-WE thrombin, an engineered thrombin mutant with cytoprotective activities that is biased toward anticoagulant and cytoprotective activity, reduced neuroinflammation and extracellular fibrin formation in SJL mice inoculated with proteolipid protein (PLP) peptide. When administered at the onset of detectable disease, E-WE thrombin significantly improved the disease severity of the initial attack as well as the relapse and delayed the onset of relapse to a similar extent as observed with methylprednisolone.

progression of stem cell therapies has shown great promise in advancing the nascent field of regenerative medicine. Considering the non-regenerative nature of the mature central nervous system, the concept that “blank” cells could be reprogrammed and functionally integrated into host neural networks remained intriguing. Previous work has also demonstrated the ability of such cells to stimulate intrinsic growth programs in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons. While embryonic stem cells demonstrated great potential in treating central nervous system pathologies, ethical and technical concerns remained. These barriers, along with the clear necessity for this type of treatment, ultimately prompted the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells. The advantage of pluripotent cells in central nervous system regeneration is multifaceted, permitting differentiation into neural stem cells, neural progenitor cells, glia, and various neuronal subpopulations. The precise spatiotemporal application of extrinsic growth factors\n              in vitro\n              , in addition to microenvironmental signaling\n              in vivo\n              , influences the efficiency of this directed differentiation. While the pluri- or multipotency of these cells is appealing, it also poses the risk of unregulated differentiation and teratoma formation. Cells of the neuroectodermal lineage, such as neuronal subpopulations and glia, have been explored with varying degrees of success. Although the risk of cancer or teratoma formation is greatly reduced, each subpopulation varies in effectiveness and is influenced by a myriad of factors, such as the timing of the transplant, pathology type, and the ratio of accompanying progenitor cells. Furthermore, successful transplantation requires innovative approaches to develop delivery vectors that can mitigate cell death and support integration. Lastly, host immune responses to allogeneic grafts must be thoroughly characterized and further developed to reduce the need for immunosuppression. Translation to a clinical setting will involve careful consideration when assessing both physiologic and functional outcomes. This review will highlight both successes and challenges faced when using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cell transplantation therapies to promote endogenous regeneration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Vidman","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yee Hang Ethan"},{"family":"Fullenkamp","given":"Nolan"},{"family":"Plant","given":"Giles W."}],"citation-key":"vidmanHumanInducedPluripotent2025","container-title":"Neural Regeneration Research","DOI":"10.4103/NRR.NRR-D-24-00901","ISSN":"1673-5374, 1876-7958","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",11]]},"language":"en","page":"3063-3075","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived therapies for regeneration after central nervous system injury","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/10.4103/NRR.NRR-D-24-00901","volume":"20"},{"id":"vinnenbergAssessingNeuroprotectiveEffects2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Vinnenberg","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Rychlik","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Oniani","given":"Tengiz"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Brandon"},{"family":"White","given":"John A."},{"family":"Kovac","given":"Stjepana"},{"family":"Meuth","given":"Sven G."},{"family":"Budde","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Hundehege","given":"Petra"}],"citation-key":"vinnenbergAssessingNeuroprotectiveEffects2024","container-title":"Experimental Neurology","container-title-short":"Experimental Neurology","DOI":"10.1016/j.expneurol.2023.114572","ISSN":"00144886","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","page":"114572","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Assessing neuroprotective effects of diroximel fumarate and siponimod via modulation of pacemaker channels in an experimental model of remyelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014488623002571","volume":"371"},{"id":"visweswaranSustainedImmunotoleranceMultiple2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Objective\n              Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has the potential to induce sustained periods of disease remission in multiple sclerosis (MS), which is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterised by demyelination and axonal degeneration.

However, the connection between viral reactivation and autoimmune biomarkers has remained unclear.Objectives To investigate immunoglobulin (Ig)G/IgA/IgM responses targeting myelin-related proteins in association with EBV and HHV-6 replication markers in RRMS.Methods We recruited 55 patients with RRMS and 63 healthy controls and assessed IgG/IgA/IgM responses against seven myelin-related components, as well as EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) and deoxyuridine-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPases). Disability was evaluated using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and disease progression using the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS).Results IgG/IgA/IgM levels targeting seven myelin-related proteins were significantly higher in RRMS than in controls. IgG against myelin basic protein (MBP) (IgG-MBP), IgM-myelin-associated glycoprotein (IgM-MAG)-37-60, IgA-MBP, and IgA-myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein (IgA-MOG-31-55) distinguished RRMS from controls with a predictive accuracy of 96.6% (sensitivity = 95.7%, specificity = 95.2%) and an area under the ROC curve of 0.991. A large part of the variance in the EDSS (around 75%) and MSSS score (62.8%) was explained by IgG-MBP, IgM-MBP, IgA-MOG-31-55, and IgM-MAG. Part of the variance (47.4%) in the IgG/IgA/IgM responses to myelin-related proteins was explained by immune responses to EBNA and deoxyuridine-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolases of EBV and HHV-6.Conclusions Autoimmune reactivities targeting myelin-related proteins are valuable biomarkers of RRMS and the severity and progression of RRMS. Reactivation of EBV and HHV-6 may trigger or maintain these autoimmune responses thereby impacting disease progression.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementAFA received funding for the project from the C2F program at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, with grant number 64.310/436/2565.

We integrate deep full-length single-nuclei sequencing of the human ventral substantia nigra with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to reveal genetic and cellular drivers of PD. Genetic risk converges onto AGTR1+ dopaminergic neurons and perineuronal (non-myelinating) oligodendrocytes, both reduced in PD, along with oligodendrocyte precursor cells, with risk enriched among disease-disrupted cellular interactions. AGTR1+ neurons represent a metabolically stressed state, not a distinct cell type, marked by renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and MAPK activation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This state is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) genetic risk. A GWAS of comorbid PD and T2D identifies significant loci in AGTR1 and TCF7L2, providing a mechanistic link between diseases, while AGTR1+ neurons specifically upregulate RAS and T2D drug targets. Comorbid PD/T2D risk is associated with multiple PD rare variant genes that cause non-Lewy body PD, mechanistically stratifying PD.Competing Interest StatementMichele T.M.

We examined whether having (mobile) internet access or actively using the internet predicted eight well-being outcomes from 2006 to 2021 among 2,414,294 individuals across 168 countries.

A parallel group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was undertaken in three centres, recruiting 160 outpatients with MS experiencing significant problems from at least one of the following: spasticity, spasms, bladder problems, tremor or pain. The interventions were oromucosal sprays of matched placebo, or whole plant CBME containing equal amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) at a dose of 2.5-120 mg of each daily, in divided doses. The primary outcome measure was a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for each patient's most troublesome symptom. Additional measures included VAS scores of other symptoms, and measures of disability, cognition, mood, sleep and fatigue.

Metformin may be a treatment option given cognitive benefits. Metformin represses monoacylglycerol lipase (Mgll), accompanied by improvements in cognition in animals.Aims To determine 1) whether metformin represses Mgll in humans, 2) if Mgll correlates with cognition/emotion recognition, and 3) if cognition differs between groups.Methods A convenience sample of seventeen PwMS and DM on metformin, 4 with MS and DM not on metformin, 10 with MS, and 21 healthy controls completed BICAMS and measures of premorbid ability, emotion recognition, mood and fatigue. Blood draw established Mgll levels. T-tests determined group differences in Mgll. Correlational analyses examined if Mgll correlated with cognition. ANCOVA evaluated differences in cognition/emotion recognition.Results Given small samples, we combined groups to determine if metformin impacted Mgll regardless of diabetes status. Significant differences in Mgll (t = -2.07, p = .05), suggested that metformin suppresses Mgll. No relationship was found between Mgll and cognition/emotion recognition. Differences were found between PwMS and DM compared to controls in verbal learning (F = 5.85, p = .02) and memory (F = 5.62, p = .02).Conclusions Metformin suppresses Mgll in humans suggesting metformin be evaluated as a potential MS treatment. Mgll did not correlate with cognition possibly due to sample size or methodology. Combined impact of MS and DM negatively impacts cognition, supporting literature demonstrating that vascular comorbidity increases risk of cognitive dysfunction.

The repair of white matter injury is dependent on the re-myelination by oligodendrocytes. Both melatonin and serotonin antagonist have been proved to protect against post-stroke white matter injury. Agomelatine (AGM) is a multi-functional treatment which is both a melatonin receptor agonist and selective serotonin receptor antagonist. Whether AGM protects against white matter injury after stroke and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, using the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of AGM in stroke mice. Sensorimotor and cognitive functions, white matter integrity, oligodendroglial regeneration and re-myelination in stroke hemisphere after AGM treatment were analyzed. We found that AGM efficiently preserved white matter integrity, reduced brain tissue loss, attenuated long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits in tMCAO models. AGM treatment promoted OPC differentiation and enhanced re-myelination both in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, although OPC proliferation was unaffected. Mechanistically, AGM activated low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling thus promoted OPC differentiation and re-myelination after stroke. Inhibition of PPARγ or knock-down of LRP1 in OPCs reversed the beneficial effects of AGM. Altogether, our data indicate that AGM represents a novel therapy against white matter injury after cerebral ischemia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Shisi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Chunyi"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Xinmei"},{"family":"Su","given":"Xiaotao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yuxin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuge"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Sanxin"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Xiaohui"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Huipeng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Tiemei"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Danli"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Zhengqi"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Tingting"}],"citation-key":"wangAgomelatinePromotesDifferentiation2024","container-title":"Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism","container-title-short":"J Cereb Blood Flow Metab","DOI":"10.1177/0271678X241260100","ISSN":"0271-678X, 1559-7016","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1487-1500","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Agomelatine promotes differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and preserves white matter integrity after cerebral ischemic stroke","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0271678X241260100","volume":"44"},{"id":"wangChimericCNStargetingpeptideEngineered2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Ying-Kai"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yun-peng"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Ming-Zhu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Lan","given":"Tian-Shu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Zhong-Quan"}],"citation-key":"wangChimericCNStargetingpeptideEngineered2023","container-title":"International Immunopharmacology","container-title-short":"International Immunopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2023.110835","ISSN":"15675769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"language":"en","page":"110835","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chimeric CNS-targeting-peptide engineered exosomes for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567576923011608","volume":"124"},{"id":"wangCombinationAlignedPDAFePLCL2025","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Biomaterial‐assisted therapeutic strategies enable precise modulation to direct endogenous cellular responses and harness regenerative capabilities for nerve repair.

However, long-term adherence to strict dietary restrictions and prolonged fasting poses challenges for most individuals and may lead to unhealthy rebound eating habits, negatively affecting overall health. As a result, a periodic fasting-mimicking diet (PFMD), involving cycles of fasting for 2 or more days while ensuring basic nutritional needs are met within a restricted caloric intake, has gained widespread acceptance. Current research indicates that a PFMD can promote stem cell regeneration, suppress inflammation, extend the health span of rodents, and improve metabolic health, among other effects. In various disease populations such as patients with diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, a PFMD has shown efficacy in alleviating disease symptoms and improving relevant markers. After conducting an extensive analysis of available research on the PFMD, it is evident that its advantages and potential applications are comparable to other fasting methods. Consequently, it is proposed in this review that a PFMD has the potential to fully replace water-only or very-low-energy fasting regimens and holds promise for application across multiple diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Ruohua"},{"family":"Lv","given":"Xinyi"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Wenyu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaoqing"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Xuanfeng"},{"family":"Huang","given":"He"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Mengxia"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Shuran"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Yucun"}],"citation-key":"wangEffectsPeriodicFastingmimicking2025","container-title":"Nutrition Reviews","DOI":"10.1093/nutrit/nuae003","ISSN":"0029-6643, 1753-4887","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/pages/standard-publication-reuse-rights","page":"e412-e426","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of the periodic fasting-mimicking diet on health, lifespan, and multiple diseases: a narrative review and clinical implications","title-short":"Effects of the periodic fasting-mimicking diet on health, lifespan, and multiple diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/83/2/e412/7591546","volume":"83"},{"id":"wangFcMultimersEffectively2023","abstract":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with limited therapeutic options.

Although studies have demonstrated that microglia facilitate remyelination in demyelinating diseases, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully characterized. We found that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), an environment sensor, was upregulated within the corpus callosum in the cuprizone model of CNS demyelination, and upregulated AhR was mainly confined to microglia. Deletion of AhR in adult microglia inhibited efficient remyelination. Transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq revealed that AhR-deficient microglia displayed impaired gene expression signatures associated with lysosome and phagocytotic pathways. Furthermore, AhR-deficient microglia showed impaired clearance of myelin debris and defected phagocytic capacity. Further investigation of target genes of AhR revealed that spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is the downstream effector of AhR and mediated the phagocytic capacity of microglia. Additionally, AhR deficiency in microglia aggravated CNS inflammation during demyelination.

Ursolic acid (UA) can be used in the MS treatment with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. However, UA is insoluble in water, which may affect its medication effectiveness. In our previous study, UAOS-Na, a water-soluble derivative of UA was obtained. In this study, we evaluated the pharmacological effects and explored its underlying mechanism of UAOS-Na on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Firstly, the pharmacodynamics of UAOS-Na was investigated in EAE and Cuprizone-induced mice. And then the possible mechanisms were investigated by TMT proteomics and verified by in vitro and in vivo experiments.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              UAOS-Na (30 mg/kg/d) delayed the onset time of EAE from 11.78 days post immunization (dpi) to 14.33 dpi, reduced the incidence from 90.0% to 42.9%. UAOS-Na (60 mg/kg/d) reduced the serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-17A, TNF-α and IL-6, reduced the mononuclear cell infiltration of spinal cord, and inhibited the overexpression of key transcription factors T-bet and ROR-γt of EAE mouse spinal cord. In addition, UAOS-Na attenuated demyelination and astrogliosis in the CNS of EAE and cuprizone-induced mice. Mechanistically, proteomics showed that 96 differential expression proteins (DEPs) were enriched and 94 were upregulated in EAE mice compared with normal group. After UAOS-Na treatment, 16 DEPs were enriched and 15 were downregulated, and these DEPs were markedly enriched in antigen processing and presentation (APP) signaling pathway. Moreover, UAOS-Na downregulated the protein levels of Tapbp and H2-T23 in MHC-I antigen presentation pathway and reduced the proliferation of splenic CD8 T cells, thereby inhibiting the CNS infiltration of CD8 T cells.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              Our findings demonstrated that UAOS-Na has both myelin protective and anti-inflammatory effects. And it could reduce the inflammation of MS by downregulating the expression of Tapbp and H2-T23 in the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Maolin"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Chenming"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yifu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Kaixian"},{"family":"Du","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Huali"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yiming"}],"citation-key":"wangUrsolicAcidDerivative2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Neurology","container-title-short":"Front.

Within days, www.cluetrain.com had ignited a vibrant global conversation challenging sacred corporate assumptions about the very nature of business in a digital world. The Wall Street Journal called it “absolutely brilliant.” Soon, executives from Fortune 500 companies everywhere were lining up to sign-on to the Manifesto. This is the book that delivers on the buzz. The Cluetrain Manifesto is a wake-up call that says business as usual is gone forever. Through the Internet, people are discovering and inventing new ways to share relevant knowledge with blinding speed. As a direct result, markets are getting smarter—and getting smarter faster than most companies. Today's markets are conversations. Their members communicate in language that is natural, open, honest, direct, funny, and often shocking. Companies that aren't listening to these exchanges are missing a dire warning. Companies that aren't engaging in them are missing an unprecedented opportunity. The Cluetrain Manifesto is the culmination of this very real phenomenon. It shares powerful, firsthand experiences describing how Internet business differs radically from the corporate status quo. The fact is that employees are getting hyperlinked even as markets are. Companies need to listen carefully to both. Forget business as usual, The Cluetrain Manifesto marks the dawn of something bigger: Markets are becoming better informed, smarter, and more demanding of qualities missing from most business organizations These networked markets are conversations in which customers are intelligent human beings, not faceless demographic sectors Today, the organizational chart is hyperlinked, not hierarchical. Respect for hands-on knowledge wins over respect for abstract authority Corporations must transform themselves into organizations that establish a genuine culture with a perspective, a personality, and a point of view Linking conversations inside the company to conversations in the marketplace will create enormous new value for companies that are clued-in.","author":[{"family":"Weinberger","given":"David"},{"family":"Levine","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Locke","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Searls","given":"Doc"}],"citation-key":"weinbergerCluetrainManifesto2000","edition":"1st edition","event-place":"Cambridge, Mass","ISBN":"978-0-7382-0244-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",1,6]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"224","publisher":"Basic Books","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Mass","source":"Amazon","title":"The Cluetrain Manifesto","type":"book"},{"id":"weinstock-guttmanOcrelizumabTreatmentRelapsingremitting2022","abstract":"Background:\n              Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience suboptimal disease control despite the use of disease-modifying therapy (DMT).\n            \n            \n              Objective:\n              To assess the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab (OCR) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and suboptimal response to prior DMTs.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              Patients with RRMS and suboptimal responses (one clinically reported relapse and/or lesion activity) after ⩾ 6 months on another DMT were enrolled.

We advance the argument that these DNEs capture the degree of expression of respective neuroanatomical patterns measured, offering a dimensional neuroanatomical representation for studying disease heterogeneity and similarities of neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. We investigate the presence of nine DNEs derived from independent yet harmonized studies on Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, late-life depression, and schizophrenia in the UK Biobank study. Phenome-wide associations align with genome-wide associations, revealing 31 genomic loci (P-value&lt;5×10−8/9) associated with the nine DNEs.The nine DNEs, along with their polygenic risk scores, significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy for 14 systemic disease categories, particularly for conditions related to mental health and the central nervous system, as well as mortality outcomes. These findings underscore the potential of the nine DNEs to capture the expression of disease-related brain phenotypes in individuals of the general population and to relate such measures with genetics, lifestyle factors, and chronic diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe gratefully acknowledge the support of the iSTAGING consortium, funded by the National Institute on Aging through grant RF1 AG054409 at the University of Pennsylvania (CD).

Respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary function assessed by spirometry, and peak cough flow were normal in patients with mild to moderate MS; however, there were large individual differences demonstrating low respiratory muscle strength in some patients. Significant associations between MEP and functional capacity and between MEP and disease severity were found, indicating that patients with impaired respiratory muscle strength have lower functional capacity and more severe disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Westerdahl","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Gunnarsson","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Wittrin","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Nilsagård","given":"Ylva"}],"citation-key":"westerdahlPulmonaryFunctionRespiratory2021","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis International","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis International","DOI":"10.1155/2021/5532776","editor":[{"family":"Stangel","given":"Martin"}],"ISSN":"2090-2662, 2090-2654","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,14]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1-7","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pulmonary Function and Respiratory Muscle Strength in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/msi/2021/5532776/","volume":"2021"},{"id":"WhatKnowledgeGraph","abstract":"Knowledge graphs are a collection of interlinked descriptions of entities that put data into context and enable data integration, analytics & sharing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,15]]},"citation-key":"WhatKnowledgeGraph","container-title":"Ontotext","language":"en-US","title":"What is a Knowledge Graph?","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-a-knowledge-graph/"},{"id":"WhatNewArtificial2023","abstract":"Learn how the 2023 Gartner Hype Cycle™ identifies exciting innovations in artificial intelligence that will be beneficial to business.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"citation-key":"WhatNewArtificial2023","container-title":"Gartner","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8]]},"language":"en","title":"What’s New in Artificial Intelligence From the 2023 Gartner Hype Cycle™","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-s-new-in-artificial-intelligence-from-the-2023-gartner-hype-cycle"},{"id":"WhatWebsiteHeatmap","abstract":"Heatmap is a data visualization tool that helps businesses analyze how visitors interact with their website.

Heart rate modulation induced by iTBS has emerged as a potential biomarker for treatment response, yet the role of white matter (WM) properties in mediating these effects is largely unexplored. In this quadruple-blind, crossover study, we investigated the relationship between WM microstructure, iTBS-driven heart rate deceleration, and antidepressant effects. Using correlational tractography, we analyzed four major WM tracts—the cingulum, fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus—and examined short-term WM microstructural changes to assess their predictive value for therapeutic outcomes. Baseline WM findings revealed that in the fornix and right dorsal cingulum fractional anisotropy (FA) negatively correlated with heart rate deceleration. Radial and mean diffusivity (MD, RD) in the fornix positively correlated with heart rate deceleration. FA in the right ventral cingulum positively correlated while MD and RD negatively correlated with symptom improvement. Longitudinally, FA increases in the left cingulum were significantly associated with greater symptom alleviation after treatment. Notably, iTBS-induced heart rate modulations correlated with clinical improvement after six weeks, while WM microstructural properties in the fornix and cingulum demonstrated predictive value for both heart rate modulation and treatment response. WM changes in the cingulum, evident as early as four weeks, highlight its unique neuroplasticity potential along iTBS intervention. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the structural connectivity patterns influencing iTBS outcomes, offering a novel foundation for more personalized therapeutic strategies in MDD.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT05260086Funding StatementThis work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fuer Bildung und Forschung, BMBF: 01 ZX 1507, PreNeSt - e:Med).

In the periphery, S1PR modulators prevent lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes, hence hampering neuroinflammation. Recent findings suggest a role for S1PR modulation in remyelination. As the Giα‐coupled S1P1 subtype is the most prominently expressed S1PR in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), selective modulation (functional antagonism) of S1P1 may have direct effects on OPC functionality. We hypothesized that functional antagonism of S1P1 by ponesimod induces remyelination by boosting OPC differentiation. In the cuprizone mouse model of demyelination, we found ponesimod to decrease the latency time of visual evoked potentials compared to vehicle conditions, which is indicative of functional remyelination. In addition, the Y maze spontaneous alternations test revealed that ponesimod reversed cuprizone‐induced working memory deficits. Myelin basic protein (MBP) immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy of the corpus callosum revealed an increase in myelination upon ponesimod treatment. Moreover, treatment with ponesimod alone or in combination with A971432, an S1P5 monoselective modulator, significantly increased primary mouse OPC differentiation based on O4 immunocytochemistry. In conclusion, S1P1 functional antagonism by ponesimod increases remyelination in the cuprizone model of demyelination and significantly increases OPC differentiation in vitro.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Willems","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Schepers","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Piccart","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Wolfs","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Hellings","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Ait‐Tihyaty","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Vanmierlo","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"willemsSphingosine1phosphateReceptor12024","container-title":"The FASEB Journal","container-title-short":"The FASEB Journal","DOI":"10.1096/fj.202301557RR","ISSN":"0892-6638, 1530-6860","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,31]]},"language":"en","page":"e23413","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The sphingosine‐1‐phosphate receptor 1 modulator ponesimod repairs cuprizone‐induced demyelination and induces oligodendrocyte differentiation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fj.202301557RR","volume":"38"},{"id":"williamsNeuralCellEngraftment2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the most common human prion disease, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with currently no treatment options.

Recognition that the central nervous system (CNS) remains plastic through life, new understanding of skilled behaviors (skills), and novel methods for engaging and guiding beneficial plasticity combine to provide unprecedented opportunities for restoring skills impaired by CNS injury or disease. The substrate of a skill is a distributed network of neurons and synapses that changes continually through life to ensure that skill performance remains satisfactory as new skills are acquired, and as growth, aging, and other life events occur. This substrate can extend from cortex to spinal cord. It has recently been given the name “heksor.” In this new context, the primary goal of rehabilitation is to enable damaged heksors to repair themselves so that their skills are once again performed well. Skill-specific practice, the mainstay of standard therapy, often fails to optimally engage the many sites and kinds of plasticity available in the damaged CNS. New noninvasive technology-based interventions can target beneficial plasticity to critical sites in damaged heksors; these interventions may thereby enable much wider beneficial plasticity that enhances skill recovery. Targeted-plasticity interventions include operant conditioning of a spinal reflex or corticospinal motor evoked potential (MEP), paired-pulse facilitation of corticospinal connections, and brain-computer interface (BCI)-based training of electroencephalographic (EEG) sensorimotor rhythms. Initial studies in people with spinal cord injury, stroke, or multiple sclerosis show that these interventions can enhance skill recovery beyond that achieved by skill-specific practice alone. After treatment ends, the repaired heksors maintain the benefits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wolpaw","given":"Jonathan R."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Aiko K."}],"citation-key":"wolpawEnhancingNeurorehabilitationTargeting2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Rehabilitation Sciences","container-title-short":"Front.

In the past two decades, stem cells have emerged as a novel therapeutic effector for neural regeneration. However, owing to the existence of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the complex microenvironment, targeted therapy still faces multiple challenges.

To develop targeting exosomes, we generated a lentivirus armed PDGFR\n              α\n              ligand that could anchor the membrane.

The data show that Bryo exhibits a powerful therapeutic effect compared with Bryo alone after exosome encapsulation. Specifically, this novel exosome-based targeting delivery of Bryo significantly improves the protection ability of the myelin sheath and promotes remyelination. Moreover, it blocks astrogliosis and axon damage, and also has an inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory microglia. The results of this investigation provide a straightforward strategy to produce targeting exosomes and indicate a potential therapeutic approach for demyelinating disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Xiao-Yu"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Bao-Ying"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Wen-Cheng"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Alexander","given":"Tyler"},{"family":"Song","given":"Sheng-Jiao"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Zhuo-Hua"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhen-Hai"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Li-Bin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xing"}],"citation-key":"wuEncapsulationBryostatin1Targeted2022","container-title":"Biomaterials Science","container-title-short":"Biomater.

However, current methods typically focus on individual genomic loci and do not account for the global genetic architecture. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of performing genome-wide fine-mapping (GWFM) with functional annotations and develop methods to facilitate GWFM. In simulations and real data analyses, GWFM outperforms current methods across multiple metrics, including error control, mapping power, resolution, precision, replication rate, and trans-ancestry phenotype prediction. Across 48 complex traits, we identify credible sets that collectively explain 18% of the SNP-based heritability on average, with 30% credible sets located outside genome-wide significant loci. Leveraging the genetic architecture estimated from GWFM, we predict that fine-mapping over 50% of would require an average of 2 million samples. Finally, as proof-of-principle, we highlight a known causal variant at FTO for body mass index and identify novel missense causal variants for schizophrenia and Crohn’s disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the 135 project for disciplines of excellence, West China Hospital, Sichuan University (ZYYC24006, ZYJC20002), Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (1177268, 1113400,1173790), the Australian Research Council (FL180100072, DP220101947, DP230101352) and the National Institute of Mental Health (5R01MH121545-05).

Ischemia leads to progressive neuronal death and synapse loss. The engulfment of stressed synapses by microglia further contributes to the disruption of the surviving neuronal network and related brain function. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective target for suppressing the microglia-mediated synapse engulfment. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an important participant in innate immune response. In the brain, microglia are the primary cell type that mediate immune response after brain insult. The intimate relationship between STING and microglia-mediated neuroinflammation has been gradually established. However, whether STING affects other functions of microglia remains elusive. In this study, we found that STING regulated microglial phagocytosis of synapses after photothrombotic stroke. The treatment of STING inhibitor H151 significantly improved the behavioral performance of injured mice in grid-walking test, cylinder test, and adhesive removal test after stroke. Moreover, the puncta number of engulfed SYP or PSD95 in microglia was reduced after consecutive H151 administration. Further analysis showed that the mRNA levels of several complement components and phagocytotic receptors were decreased after STING inhibition. Transcriptional factor STAT1 is known for regulating most of the decreased molecules. After STING inhibition, the nucleus translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 was also suppressed in microglia. Our data uncovered the novel regulatory effects of STING in microglial phagocytosis after stroke, and further emphasized STING as a potential drug-able target for post-stroke functional recovery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Chaoran"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shiwen"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ao"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Fengsheng"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Long"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Hong"}],"citation-key":"wuSTINGInhibitionSuppresses2024","container-title":"Journal

Transforming growth factor‐beta1 (TGF‐β1) is a multifunctional cytokine participating in abundant physiological and pathological processes in CNS. However, the effects of TGF‐β1 on CNS demyelinating disease and its underlying mechanisms are controversial and not well understood. Herein, we evaluated the protective potential of TGF‐β1 in a rodent demyelinating model established by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) injection. It was identified that supplement of TGF‐β1 evidently rescued the cognitive deficit and motor dysfunction in LPC modeling mice assessed by novel object recognition and balance beam behavioral tests. Besides, quantified by luxol fast blue staining, immunofluorescence, and western blot, administration of TGF‐β1 was found to significantly ameliorate the demyelinating lesion and reactive astrogliosis by suppressing p38 MAPK pathway. Mechanistically, the results of in vitro experiments indicated that treatment of TGF‐β1 could directly promote the differentiation and migration of cultured oligodendrocytes.

The activation and differentiation fate regulation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) represent one of the most promising repair approaches. Metformin has been extensively studied for its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, and autophagy-regulating properties in central nervous system diseases. However, the effects of metformin on endogenous NSCs remains to be elucidated.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The proliferation and differentiation abilities of NSCs were evaluated using CCK-8 assay, EdU/Ki67 staining and immunofluorescence staining. Changes in the expression of key proteins related to ferroptosis in NSCs were detected using Western Blot and immunofluorescence staining. The levels of reactive oxygen species, glutathione and tissue iron were measured using corresponding assay kits. Changes in mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential were observed using transmission electron microscopy and JC-1 fluorescence probe.

Peripheral T lymphocytes, especially regulatory T cells (Tregs), are known to infiltrate into ischemic brain and play a crucial role in modulation of inflammatory response there.

These diseases also lead to the loss of neuronal cell function, which causes alterations in the nervous system structure, resulting in the degeneration or death of nerve cells throughout the body. This causes problems with movement (ataxia) and mental dysfunction (dementia), both of which are commonly observed symptoms in Alzheimerʼs disease, Parkinsonʼs disease, Huntingtonʼs disease, and multiple sclerosis. Medicinal mushrooms are higher fungi with nutraceutical properties and are low in calories and fat. They are also a rich source of nutrients and bioactive compounds such as carbohydrates, proteins, fibers, and vitamins that have been used in the treatment of many ailments. Medicinal mushrooms such as Pleurotus giganteus, Ganoderma lucidium, and Hericium erinaceus are commonly produced worldwide for use as health supplements and medicine. Medicinal mushrooms and their extracts have a large number of bioactive compounds, such as polysaccharide β-glucan, or polysaccharide-protein complexes, like lectins, lactones, terpenoids, alkaloids, antibiotics, and metal-chelating agents.

These hemichannels remain closed until they combine to create gap junctions, directly connecting neighboring cells. Changes in the intracellular or extracellular environment are believed to trigger the opening of hemichannels, creating a passage between the inside and outside of the cell. The size of the channel pore depends on the Cx isoform and cellular context-specific effects such as posttranslational modifications. Hemichannels allow various bioactive molecules, under ~1 kDa, to move in and out of the host cell in the direction of the electrochemical gradient. In this review, we explore the fundamental roles of Cxs and their clinical implications in various neurological dysfunctions, including hereditary diseases, ischemic brain disorders, degenerative conditions, demyelinating disorders, and psychiatric illnesses. The influence of Cxs on the pathomechanisms of different neurological disorders varies depending on the circumstances. Hemichannels are hypothesized to contribute to proinflammatory effects by releasing ATP, adenosine, glutamate, and other bioactive molecules, leading to neuroglial inflammation.

Naphthalenedione, present in numerous plants, is being explored as a potential medicine for MS due to its immunomodulatory properties. However, its effects on lymphocytes can vary depending on factors such as the specific compound, concentration, and experimental conditions. In this study, we aim to explore the therapeutic potential of 2-bromo-1,4-naphthalenedione (BrQ), a derivative of naphthalenedione, in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. We observed that mice treated with BrQ exhibited reduced severity of EAE symptoms, including lower clinical scores, decreased leukocyte infiltration, and less extensive demyelination in central nervous system. Furthermore, it was noted that BrQ does not directly affect the remyelination process.

To advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development, maturation, and aging, we constructed a detailed single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, encompassing over 1.3 million nuclei from 284 postmortem samples spanning the full human lifespan (0-97 years). This atlas reveals distinct phases of transcriptomic activity: a dynamic developmental period, stabilization during midlife, and subtle yet coordinated changes in late adulthood. Modeling non-linear age trends across the lifespan shows ten distinct trajectories of the entire transcriptome from all cell types, with notable findings in neurons and microglia, linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and Alzheimer’s disease risk, respectively. Moreover, excitatory neurons exhibit a convergence of gene expression patterns across the lifespan, suggesting the emergence of a common molecular signature of aging. Pseudotime analysis tracing the progression of cellular lineages throughout life reveals key gene clusters with dynamic expression changes that reflect development, maturation, and aging, as well as their connection to brain-related diseases. We uncover significant circadian rhythm reprogramming in late adulthood, characterized by disruption of core clock gene rhythmicity and the emergence of new rhythmic patterns, particularly within microglia and oligodendrocytes. This comprehensive single-cell atlas provides a baseline for understanding the molecular transitions from development through successful aging in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe acknowledge the generous support of the National Institute on Aging, who provided funding for this research through the following NIH grants: R01AG067025, R01AG082185, and R01AG065582.

Currently, there is no effective drug for treating patients with ALS. Herbal medicine, used to treat various diseases, has multitarget effects and does not usually induce side effects. Each bioactive component in such herbal combinations can exert a mechanism of action to increase therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we investigated the efficacy of an herbal formula, comprising Achyranthes bidentata Blume, Eucommia ulmoides Oliver, and Paeonia lactiflora Pallas, in suppressing the pathological mechanism of ALS in male hSOD1G93A mice. Herbal formula extract (HFE) (1 mg/g) were orally administered once daily for six weeks, starting at eight weeks of age, in hSOD1G93A transgenic mice. To evaluate the effects of HFE, we performed footprint behavioral tests, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry to detect protein expression and quantitative PCR to detect mRNA levels in the muscles and spinal cord of hSOD1G93A mice. HFE-treated hSOD1G93A mice showed increased anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and regulation of autophagy in the muscles and spinal cord. Thus, HEF can be therapeutic candidates for inhibiting disease progression in patients with ALS. This study has some limitations. Although this experiment was performed only in male hSOD1G93A mice, studies that investigate the efficacy of HEF in various ALS models including female mice, such as mice modeling TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) and ORF 72 on chromosome 9 (C9orf72) ALS, are required before it can be established that HEF are therapeutic candidates for patients with ALS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Eun Jin"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Sun Hwa"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Mudan"}],"citation-key":"yangTreatmentHerbalFormula2022","container-title":"Mediators of Inflammation","container-title-short":"Mediators of Inflammation","DOI":"10.1155/2022/4754732","editor":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Feng"}],"ISSN":"1466-1861, 0962-9351","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,4]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1-10","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Treatment with Herbal Formula Extract in the hSOD1G93A Mouse Model Attenuates Muscle and Spinal Cord Dysfunction via Anti-Inflammation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2022/4754732/","volume":"2022"},{"id":"yazdaniIL37SuppressesCNS2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Yazdani","given":"Reza"},{"family":"Naziri","given":"Hamed"},{"family":"Azizi","given":"Gholamreza"},{"family":"Ciric","given":"Bogoljub"},{"family":"Askari","given":"Mozhde"},{"family":"Ahmadi","given":"Amir Moghadam"},{"family":"Aseervatham","given":"Jaya"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guang-Xian"},{"family":"Rostami","given":"Abdolmohamad"}],"citation-key":"yazdaniIL37SuppressesCNS2024","container-title":"Journal of Neuroinflammation","container-title-short":"J Neuroinflammation","DOI":"10.1186/s12974-024-03295-1","ISSN":"1742-2094","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,19]]},"language":"en","page":"301","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"IL-37 suppresses CNS autoimmunity by increasing the frequency of Treg cells and reducing CD4 + T cell-derived IL-10 production","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-024-03295-1","volume":"21"},{"id":"yenikEffectSelfacupressureFatigue2022","abstract":"AIM: This study was conducted as a randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of self-acupressure on fatigue in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). METHOD: The sample of the study consisted of 123 patients (41 in the experiment group, 40 in the sham group, and 42 controls) who were admitted to a neurology clinic in a university hospital. To collect data a patient information form, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and Mini-Mental Status Examination were used. Depressive mood and sleep quality, which may affect fatigue, were evaluated using the Beck Depression Scale (BDI-II) and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. The patients in the experimental group were applied acupressure by use of LI4 (He Gu), SP6 (San Yin Jiao) and ST36 (Zu San Li) points. RESULTS: The majority of patients were female (67.5%) and the mean age was 41.18. In addition, the mean BDI-II score of the patients was found to be 15.54, and the mean score of PSQI was 6.78 and the mean scores of these scales were similar in all groups. When the baseline FSS score means were examined, there was no significant difference among the groups (Acupressure:5.54 ± 0.87, Control:5.40 ± 0.92, and Sham:5.50 ± 0.99; p = 0.816). In the 4th week, there was a significant decrease in the mean score of fatigue of the experimental group compared to the other two groups (Acupressure:4.15 ± 1.09, Control:5.47 ± 1.11, Sham:5.34 ± 1.14, p < 0,001).

Signalling through the Nogo receptor 1 complex has been shown to be associated with axonal degeneration in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, and neuronal deletion of this receptor homologue, in a disease specific manner, is associated with preserving axons even in the context of neuroinflammation. The local delivery of Nogo receptor(1-310)-Fc, a therapeutic fusion protein, has been successfully applied as a treatment in animal models of spinal cord injury and glaucoma. As multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis exhibit large numbers of inflammatory cell infiltrates within the CNS lesions, we utilized transplantable haematopoietic stem cells as a cellular delivery method of the Nogo receptor(1-310)-Fc fusion protein. We identified CNS-infiltrating macrophages as the predominant immune-positive cell type that overexpressed myc-tagged Nogo receptor(1-310)-Fc fusion protein at the peak stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These differentiated phagocytes were predominant during the extensive demyelination and axonal damage, which are associated with the engulfment of the protein complex of Nogo receptor(1-310)-Fc binding to myelin ligands. Importantly, mice transplanted with haematopoietic stem cells transduced with the lentiviral vector carrying Nogo receptor(1-310)-Fc and recovered from the peak of neurological decline during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, exhibiting axonal regeneration and eventual remyelination in the white matter tracts. There were no immunomodulatory effects of the transplanted, genetically modified haematopoietic stem cells on immune cell lineages of recipient female mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We propose that cellular delivery of Nogo receptor(1-310)-Fc fusion protein through genetically modified haematopoietic stem cells can modulate multifocal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis lesions and potentiate neurological recovery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ye","given":"Sining"},{"family":"Theotokis","given":"Paschalis"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jae Young"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Min Joung"},{"family":"Nheu","given":"Danica"},{"family":"Ellen","given":"Olivia"},{"family":"Bedford","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Ramanujam","given":"Padmanabhan"},{"family":"Wright","given":"David K"},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Stuart J"},{"family":"Alrehaili","given":"Amani"},{"family":"Bakhuraysah","given":"Maha"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Jung Hee"},{"family":"Siatskas","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Tremblay","given":"Cedric S"},{"family":"Curtis","given":"David J"},{"family":"Grigoriadis","given":"Nikolaos"},{"family":"Monif","given":"Mastura"},{"family":"Strittmatter","given":"Stephen M"},{"family":"Petratos","given":"Steven"}],"citation-key":"yeNogoReceptorFcDelivered2023","container-title":"Brain Communications","DOI":"10.1093/braincomms/fcad108","ISSN":"2632-1297","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,2]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"fcad108","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Nogo receptor-Fc delivered by haematopoietic cells enhances neurorepair in a multiple sclerosis model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcad108/7103334","volume":"5"},{"id":"yilmazSinglenucleusMultiomicsBrains2025","abstract":"The apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE-ε4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet its molecular impact on cerebrovascular biology remains inconclusive, particularly in underrepresented populations with elevated vascular burden. Individuals from Hispanic ancestry experience disproportionately high rates of cerebrovascular pathology, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of cerebrovascular pathology in AD. Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snSeq) on 413,175 nuclei from 52 postmortem Hispanic brains to determine APOE-ε4-associated cell type specific transcriptomic changes in a population with elevated cerebrovascular risk. We identified a conserved molecular signature marked by dysregulated extracellular matrix deposition and focal adhesion signaling in astrocytes. These findings were replicated in the non-Hispanic ROSMAP cohort (n = 424) snSeq. Findings were validated in isogenic human iPSC-derived astrocytes, humanized APOE targeted replacement mouse brains, and post-mortem human brains at protein and chromatin accessibility level.

However, safe, effective, and controllable microglial regulation still faces formidable challenges. Although some anti‐inflammatory factors promote microglia polarization, their short half‐life, high cost, unpredictable in vivo behavior, and complex delivery operations, hamper their clinical application. Here, inspired by the natural microhemorrhage cleaning mechanism, an MG1 peptide and RVG29 peptide engineered nanoerythrocyte (NEMR) that can reprogram microglia are developed from classical M1 toward alternative M2 by inducing heme oxygenase‐1 (HO‐1), stimulating Notch1/Hes1/Stat3 signaling, and further inhibiting NF‐κB p65 translocation. Moreover, anti‐inflammatory carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin produced by endogenous metabolism of heme further reinforces the anti‐inflammatory effect. In middle cerebral artery occlusion and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, a satisfactory prognosis is achieved, with precise regulation of inflammatory microglia in lesion sites, increased expression of anti‐inflammatory factors, reduced blood–brain barrier permeability, as well as promotion of neurogenesis and functional recovery. Furthermore, NEMR can be integrated with clinical therapeutic agents, which facilitates precise drug delivery to enhance therapeutic effects. Hence, the natural nanoerythrocytes, as a feasible, efficient, safe, and practical tool, provides a new strategy for rebalancing of the immune environment in the CNS disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Yin","given":"Na"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yuzhen"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Changhua"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhi‐Hao"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Wenyan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Kaixiang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhenzhong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Junjie"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Jinjin"}],"citation-key":"yinEngineeredNanoerythrocytesAlleviate2022","container-title":"Advanced Materials","container-title-short":"Advanced Materials","DOI":"10.1002/adma.202201322","ISSN":"0935-9648, 1521-4095","issue":"27","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"language":"en","page":"2201322","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Engineered Nanoerythrocytes Alleviate Central Nervous System Inflammation by Regulating the Polarization of Inflammatory Microglia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202201322","volume":"34"},{"id":"yingSmallMoleculeCompoundBaicalein2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ying","given":"Sai"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Haihao"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Qianlan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Zhao"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Nanting"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chong-Zhi"},{"family":"Wan","given":"Chunping"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Chun-Su"}],"citation-key":"yingSmallMoleculeCompoundBaicalein2023","container-title":"International Immunopharmacology","container-title-short":"International Immunopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109562","ISSN":"15675769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","page":"109562","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Small-Molecule compound baicalein alleviates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by suppressing pathogenetic CXCR6+ CD4 cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567576922010475","volume":"114"},{"id":"yinMicrobiotaderivedAcetateAttenuates2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Increased neuroinflammation in brain regions regulating sympathetic nerves is associated with hypertension.

To gain insights into the significance of Klk6 to oligodendrocyte biology, we investigated the impact of global Klk6 gene knockout on CNS developmental myelination using the spinal cord of male and female mice as a model. Results demonstrate that constitutive loss of Klk6 expression accelerates oligodendrocyte differentiation developmentally, including increases in the expression of myelin proteins such as MBP, PLP and CNPase, in the number of CC‐1+ mature oligodendrocytes, and myelin thickness by the end of the first postnatal week. Co‐ordinate elevations in the pro‐myelinating signaling pathways ERK and AKT, expression of fatty acid 2‐hydroxylase, and myelin regulatory transcription factor were also observed in the spinal cord of 7d Klk6 knockouts. LC/MS/MS quantification of spinal cord lipids showed sphingosine and sphingomyelins to be elevated in Klk6 knockouts at the peak of myelination. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs)‐derived from Klk6 knockouts, or wild type OPCs‐treated with a Klk6 inhibitor (DFKZ‐251), also showed increased MBP and PLP. Moreover, inhibition of Klk6 in OPC cultures enhanced brain derived neurotrophic factor‐driven differentiation. Altogether, these findings suggest that oligodendrocyte‐derived Klk6 may operate as an autocrine or paracrine rheostat, or brake, on pro‐myelinating signaling serving to regulate myelin homeostasis developmentally and in the adult. These findings document for the first time that inhibition of Klk6 globally, or specifically in oligodendrocyte progenitors, is a strategy to increase early stages of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin production in the CNS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Yoon","given":"Hyesook"},{"family":"Triplet","given":"Erin M."},{"family":"Simon","given":"Whitney L."},{"family":"Choi","given":"Chan‐Il"},{"family":"Kleppe","given":"Laurel S."},{"family":"De Vita","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Aubry K."},{"family":"Scarisbrick","given":"Isobel A."}],"citation-key":"yoonBlockingKallikrein62022","container-title":"Glia","container-title-short":"Glia","DOI":"10.1002/glia.24100","ISSN":"0894-1491, 1098-1136","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","page":"430-450","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Blocking Kallikrein 6 promotes developmental myelination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/glia.24100","volume":"70"},{"id":"yoonBlockingThrombinReceptor2020","abstract":"Myelin loss limits neurological recovery and myelin regeneration and is critical for restoration of function. We recently discovered that global knock-out of the thrombin receptor, also known as Protease Activated Receptor 1 (PAR1), accelerates myelin development. Here we demonstrate that knocking out PAR1 also promotes myelin regeneration. Outcomes in two unique models of myelin injury and repair, that is lysolecithin or cuprizone-mediated demyelination, showed that PAR1 knock-out in male mice improves replenishment of myelinating cells and remyelinated nerve fibers and slows early axon damage. Improvements in myelin regeneration in PAR1 knock-out mice occurred in tandem with a skewing of reactive astrocyte signatures toward a prorepair phenotype. In cell culture, the promyelinating effects of PAR1 loss of function are consistent with possible direct effects on the myelinating potential of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), in addition to OPC-indirect effects involving enhanced astrocyte expression of promyelinating factors, such as BDNF. These findings highlight previously unrecognized roles of PAR1 in myelin regeneration, including integrated actions across the oligodendrocyte and astroglial compartments that are at least partially mechanistically linked to the powerful BDNF-TrkB neurotrophic signaling system. Altogether, findings suggest PAR1 may be a therapeutically tractable target for demyelinating disorders of the CNS.\n            \n              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT\n              Replacement of oligodendroglia and myelin regeneration holds tremendous potential to improve function across neurological conditions. Here we demonstrate Protease Activated Receptor 1 (PAR1) is an important regulator of the capacity for myelin regeneration across two experimental murine models of myelin injury. PAR1 is a G-protein-coupled receptor densely expressed in the CNS, however there is limited information regarding its physiological roles in health and disease. Using a combination of PAR1 knock-out mice, oligodendrocyte monocultures and oligodendrocyte-astrocyte cocultures, we demonstrate blocking PAR1 improves myelin production by a mechanism related to effects across glial compartments and linked in part to regulatory actions toward growth factors such as BDNF. These findings set the stage for development of new clinically relevant myelin regeneration strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Yoon","given":"Hyesook"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Chan-Il"},{"family":"Triplet","given":"Erin M."},{"family":"Langley","given":"Monica R."},{"family":"Kleppe","given":"Laurel S."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Ha Neui"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Whitney L."},{"family":"Scarisbrick","given":"Isobel A."}],"citation-key":"yoonBlockingThrombinReceptor2020","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

Besides the defect in the myelin repair process, the balance change in inflammatory and anti- inflammatory cytokines is one of the most significant factors in MS pathogenesis. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of co-overexpressing beta interferon (IFN-β) and Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in human adipose-derived stem cells (IFN-β/LIF-hADSCs) on the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). 12 days after the induction of EAE on female mice C57Bl/6 with MOG35-55 and the emergence of primary clinical signs, the IFN-β/LIF-hADSCs were injected into the mice tail vein of the EAE mice. The mice were sacrificed after 32 days and the spinal cords of the experimental groups were dissected out for the histopathologic and real-time RT-PCR studies.

Objective: To examine the prebiotic properties of Palmaria palmata aqueous extract (Palmaria p.) and its potential as a neuroprotective agent in multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: eighty-eight adult Swiss mice were divided into four male and four female groups, including a control group (distilled water), Palmaria p.-treated group (600 mg/kg b.w.), cuprizone (CPZ)-treated group (mixed chow 0.2%), and a group treated with both CPZ and Palmaria p.

To examine the spontaneous recovery, the rest of the mice continued until the end of week seven. Behavioral (grip strength (GS) and open field tests (OFT)), microbiome, and histological assessments for general morphology of corpus callous (CC) were all conducted at the end of week five and week 7. Results: Palmaria p. can potentially protect against CPZ-induced MS with variable degrees in male and female Swiss mice. This protection was demonstrated through three key findings: (1) increased F/B ratio and expansion of the beneficial Lactobacillus, Proteobacteria, and Bactriodia communities. (2) Protection against the decline in GS induced by CPZ and prevented CPZ-induced anxiety in OFT. (3) Preservation of structural integrity. Conclusions: Because of its propensity to promote microbiota alterations, its antioxidant activity, and its content of −3 fatty acids, Palmaria p. could be a promising option for MS patients and could be beneficial as a potential probiotic for the at-risk groups as a preventive measure against MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Yousof","given":"Shimaa Mohammad"},{"family":"Alghamdi","given":"Badrah S."},{"family":"Alqurashi","given":"Thamer"},{"family":"Alam","given":"Mohammad Zubair"},{"family":"Tash","given":"Reham"},{"family":"Tanvir","given":"Imrana"},{"family":"Kaddam","given":"Lamis AbdelGadir"}],"citation-key":"yousofModulationGutMicrobiome2023","container-title":"Pharmaceuticals","container-title-short":"Pharmaceuticals","DOI":"10.3390/ph16101355","ISSN":"1424-8247","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1355","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Modulation of Gut Microbiome Community Mitigates Multiple Sclerosis in a Mouse Model: The Promising Role of Palmaria palmata Alga as a Prebiotic","title-short":"Modulation of Gut Microbiome Community Mitigates Multiple Sclerosis in a Mouse Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/16/10/1355","volume":"16"},{"id":"yuanNaturalCompoundsPotential2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Yuan","given":"Jinfeng"},{"family":"Tao","given":"Yanlin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Mengxue"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xiaojun"}],"citation-key":"yuanNaturalCompoundsPotential2024","container-title":"Phytomedicine","container-title-short":"Phytomedicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.phymed.2023.155248","ISSN":"09447113","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","page":"155248","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Natural compounds as potential therapeutic candidates for multiple sclerosis: Emerging preclinical evidence","title-short":"Natural compounds as potential therapeutic candidates for multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0944711323006074","volume":"123"},{"id":"yuanTotalAstragalosidesPromote2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Yuan","given":"Jinfeng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Nuo"},{"family":"Tao","given":"Yanlin"},{"family":"Han","given":"Xinyan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Liu"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jinglei"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Haojieyin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaoxia"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Hailin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xiaojun"}],"citation-key":"yuanTotalAstragalosidesPromote2022","container-title":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","container-title-short":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jep.2022.115622","ISSN":"03788741","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11]]},"language":"en","page":"115622","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Total astragalosides promote oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and enhance remyelination in cuprizone-induced mice through suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378874122006614","volume":"298"},{"id":"yuanxEffectDifferentAdministration2021","abstract":"Background: Despite the vitamin D treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), there continues to be controversial discrepancy in outcomes according to the current research.

Real-time bioenergetic analysis of the patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed enhanced glycolysis, supporting the altered metabolic state of immune cells. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice treated with the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose ameliorated the disease progression and inhibited the disease pathology significantly by promoting the antiinflammatory phenotype of monocytes/macrophage in the central nervous system. Our study provided a proof of principle for how a blood-based metabolomic approach using patient samples could lead to the identification of a therapeutic target for developing potential therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zahoor","given":"Insha"},{"family":"Suhail","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Datta","given":"Indrani"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Mohammad Ejaz"},{"family":"Poisson","given":"Laila M."},{"family":"Waters","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Rashid","given":"Faraz"},{"family":"Bin","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Jaspreet"},{"family":"Cerghet","given":"Mirela"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Ashok"},{"family":"Hoda","given":"Md Nasrul"},{"family":"Rattan","given":"Ramandeep"},{"family":"Mangalam","given":"Ashutosh K."},{"family":"Giri","given":"Shailendra"}],"citation-key":"zahoorBloodbasedUntargetedMetabolomics2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

We studied the effect of maresin 1 (MaR1) on the progression of disease in a relapsing-remitting form of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE). Treatment with MaR1 in RR-EAE accelerated inflammation resolution, protected against neurological deficits, and delayed disease progression by decreasing immune cell infiltration (CD4+IL17+ and CD4+IFN\n            γ\n            +) into the CNS. Furthermore, the administration of MaR1 increased the production of IL-10, predominantly in macrophages and CD4+ cells. However, neutralizing IL-10 with an anti-IL-10 antibody abolished the protective effect of MaR1 on RR-EAE, suggesting that IL-10 plays a role in mediating the protective effect of MaR1 on EAE. Metabolism is rapidly becoming recognized as an important factor influencing the effector function of many immune cells. Using cutting-edge metabolic assays, our study revealed that compared with vehicle treatment, MaR1 treatment effectively restored the metabolic dysregulation observed in CD4+ cells, macrophages, and microglia in the treated group. Furthermore, MaR1 treatment reversed defective efferocytosis in EAE mice, which was potentially facilitated by the induction of metabolic alterations in macrophages and microglia. MaR1 treatment also protected myelin in the EAE group and regulated the metabolism of O4+ oligodendrocytes by restoring metabolic dysregulation through improved mitochondrial function and decreased glycolysis. Overall, in a preclinical MS animal model, MaR1 treatment produced anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. It also triggered metabolic reprogramming in disease-associated cell types, accelerated efferocytosis, and preserved myelination.

Much anecdotal evidence suggests that cannabinoids could help these symptoms. Our aim was to test the notion that cannabinoids have a beneficial effect on spasticity and other symptoms related to multiple sclerosis. METHODS: We did a randomised, placebo-controlled trial, to which we enrolled 667 patients with stable multiple sclerosis and muscle spasticity. 630 participants were treated at 33 UK centres with oral cannabis extract (n=211), Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC; n=206), or placebo (n=213). Trial duration was 15 weeks. Our primary outcome measure was change in overall spasticity scores, using the Ashworth scale. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 611 of 630 patients were followed up for the primary endpoint. We noted no treatment effect of cannabinoids on the primary outcome (p=0.40). The estimated difference in mean reduction in total Ashworth score for participants taking cannabis extract compared with placebo was 0.32 (95% CI -1.04 to 1.67), and for those taking Delta9-THC versus placebo it was 0.94 (-0.44 to 2.31). There was evidence of a treatment effect on patient-reported spasticity and pain (p=0.003), with improvement in spasticity reported in 61% (n=121, 95% CI 54.6-68.2), 60% (n=108, 52.5-66.8), and 46% (n=91, 39.0-52.9) of participants on cannabis extract, Delta9-THC, and placebo, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with cannabinoids did not have a beneficial effect on spasticity when assessed with the Ashworth scale. However, though there was a degree of unmasking among the patients in the active treatment groups, objective improvement in mobility and patients' opinion of an improvement in pain suggest cannabinoids might be clinically useful.","author":[{"literal":"Zajicek J"},{"literal":"Fox P"},{"literal":"Sanders H"},{"literal":"Wright D"},{"literal":"Vickery J"},{"literal":"Nunn A"},{"literal":"Thompson A"}],"citation-key":"zajicekjCannabinoidsTreatmentSpasticity2003","container-title":"Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14738-1","ISSN":"0140-6736","issue":"9395","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"page":"1517-26","title":"Cannabinoids for treatment of spasticity and other symptoms related to multiple sclerosis (CAMS study): multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trial","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14738-1","volume":"362"},{"id":"zajicekjEffectDronabinolProgression2013","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Laboratory evidence has shown that cannabinoids might have a neuroprotective action. We investigated whether oral dronabinol (Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol) might slow the course of progressive multiple sclerosis. METHODS: In this multicentre, parallel, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we recruited patients aged 18-65 years with primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis from 27 UK neurology or rehabilitation departments. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive dronabinol or placebo for 36 months; randomisation was by stochastic minimisation, using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, balanced according to expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score, centre, and disease type. Maximum dose was 28 mg per day, titrated against bodyweight and adverse effects. Primary outcomes were EDSS score progression (masked assessor, time to progression of ≥1 point from a baseline score of 4·0-5·0 or ≥0·5 points from a baseline score of ≥5·5, confirmed after 6 months) and change from baseline in the physical impact subscale of the 29-item multiple sclerosis impact scale (MSIS-29-PHYS). All patients who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial (ISRCTN 62942668). FINDINGS: Of the 498 patients randomly assigned to a treatment group, 329 received at least one dose of dronabinol and 164 received at least one dose of placebo (five did not receive the allocated intervention). 145 patients in the dronabinol group had EDSS score progression (0·24 first progression events per patient-year; crude rate) compared with 73 in the placebo group (0·23 first progression events per patient-year; crude rate); HR for prespecified primary analysis was 0·92 (95% CI 0·68-1·23; p=0·57). Mean yearly change in MSIS-29-PHYS score was 0·62 points (SD 3·29) in the dronabinol group versus 1·03 points (3·74) in the placebo group. Primary analysis with a multilevel model gave an estimated between-group difference (dronabinol-placebo) of -0·9 points (95% CI -2·0 to 0·2). We noted no serious safety concerns (114 [35%] patients in the dronabinol group had at least one serious adverse event, compared with 46 [28%] in the placebo group). INTERPRETATION: Our results show that dronabinol has no overall effect on the progression of multiple sclerosis in the progressive phase. The findings have implications for the design of future studies of progressive multiple sclerosis, because lower than expected progression rates might have affected our ability to detect clinical change.

Here we report the results of the Multiple Sclerosis and Extract of Cannabis (MUSEC) study that aimed to substantiate the patient based findings of previous studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stable MS at 22 UK centres were randomised to oral cannabis extract (CE) (N=144) or placebo (N=135), stratified by centre, walking ability and use of antispastic medication. This double blind, placebo controlled, phase III study had a screening period, a 2 week dose titration phase from 5 mg to a maximum of 25 mg of tetrahydrocannabinol daily and a 10 week maintenance phase. The primary outcome measure was a category rating scale (CRS) measuring patient reported change in muscle stiffness from baseline. Further CRSs assessed body pain, spasms and sleep quality. Three validated MS specific patient reported outcome measures assessed aspects of spasticity, physical and psychological impact, and walking ability. RESULTS: The rate of relief from muscle stiffness after 12 weeks was almost twice as high with CE than with placebo (29.4% vs. 15.7%; OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.24 to 4.13; p=0.004, one sided). Similar results were found after 4 weeks and 8 weeks, and also for all further CRSs. Results from the MS scales supported these findings. CONCLUSION: The study met its primary objective to demonstrate the superiority of CE over placebo in the treatment of muscle stiffness in MS. This was supported by results for secondary efficacy variables. Adverse events in participants treated with CE were consistent with the known side effects of cannabinoids.

CAQK peptide (peptide sequence: cysteine–alanine–glutamine–lysine) was previously introduced as a targeting peptide for the injured site of the brain. In the present study, we aimed to develop a multifunctional system using nanoparticles coated by CAQK peptide, to target the demyelinated lesions in animal model of multiple sclerosis. We investigated the binding of fluorescein amidite–labelled CAQK and fluorescein amidite–labelled CGGK (as control) on mouse brain sections. Then, the porous silicon nanoparticles were synthesized and coupled with fluorescein amidite–labelled CAQK. Five days after lysolecithin-induced demyelination, male mice were intravenously injected with methylprednisolone-loaded porous silicon nanoparticles conjugated to CAQK or the same amount of free methylprednisolone. Our results showed that fluorescein amidite–labelled CAQK recognizes demyelinated lesions in brain sections of animal brains injected with lysolecithin. In addition, intravenous application of methylprednisolone-loaded nanoparticle porous silicon conjugated to CAQK at a single dose of 0.24 mg reduced the levels of microglial activation and astrocyte reactivation in the lesions of mouse corpus callosum after 24 and 48 h. No significant effect was observed following the injection of the same dose of free methylprednisolone.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit potent immunomodulatory capabilities, including the suppression of immune cell functions and anti‐inflammatory cytokine production. Female C57BL/6 mice (8–10 weeks old) were divided into three groups: 1. Control, 2. Allogeneic MSCs (ALO) treatment, and 3. Syngeneic MSCs (SYN) treatment. To induce EAE, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein was injected subcutaneously with complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by intraperitoneal pertussis toxin. On Days 6 and 12 postimmunization, the treatment groups received intraperitoneal injections of 2 × 10\n              6\n              MSCs. Daily clinical and weight assessments were performed, and on Day 25, the mice were euthanized. At the end of the period, brain histological analysis was conducted to quantify lymphocyte infiltration. T‐cell characteristics were determined using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and Real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). The assessment of transcription factor expression levels in the CNS was also performed using RT‐PCR. Compared to the control group, both the allogeneic (ALO) and syngeneic (SYN) groups demonstrated significantly reduced disease progression. The maximum clinical scores for the control, ALO, and SYN groups were 4.4 ± 0.1, 2.4 ± 0.2, and 2.1 ± 0.2, respectively (ALO and SYN vs. Control:\n              p\n               < .001). In comparison to the control group, histological studies demonstrated that the allogeneic and syngeneic groups had less lymphocytic infiltration (ALO: 1.4 ± 0.1, SYN: 1.2 ± 0.2, and control: 2.8 ± 0.15;\n              p\n               < .001) and demyelination (ALO: 1.2 ± 0.15, SYN: 1.1 ± 0.1 and control: 2.9 ± 0.1,\n              p\n               < .001).

Additionally, ALO and SYN groups compared to the control group, expressed more Th2 and Treg cytokines and transcription factors (IL‐4: 4.25, 4.63; STAT6: 2.78, 2.96; GATA3: 2.91, 3.08; IL‐27: 2.32, 2.46, IL‐33: 2.71, 2.85; TGF‐β: 4.8, 5.05; IL‐10: 4.71, 4.93; CTLA‐4: 7.72, 7.95; PD1: 4.12,4.35; Foxp3: 3.82,4.08, respectively). This research demonstrated that MSCs possess the potential to be a therapeutic option for MS and related CNS inflammatory disorders. Their immunomodulatory properties, coupled with the observed reductions in disease severity, lymphocytic infiltration, and demyelination, indicate that MSCs could play a crucial role in altering the course of MS by mitigating inflammatory immune responses and promoting regulatory immune processes. These findings open up new possibilities for the development of MSC‐based therapies for MS, and further investigation and clinical trials may be warranted to explore their efficacy and safety in human patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zargarani","given":"Simin"},{"family":"Tavaf","given":"Maryam J."},{"family":"Soltanmohammadi","given":"Azita"},{"family":"Yazdanpanah","given":"Esmaeil"},{"family":"Baharlou","given":"Rasoul"},{"family":"Yousefi","given":"Bahman"},{"family":"Sadighimoghaddam","given":"Bizhan"},{"family":"Esmaeili","given":"Seyed‐Alireza"},{"family":"Haghmorad","given":"Dariush"}],"citation-key":"zargaraniAdiposederivedMesenchymalStem2024","container-title":"Cell Biology International","container-title-short":"Cell Biology International","DOI":"10.1002/cbin.12171","ISSN":"1065-6995, 1095-8355","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8]]},"language":"en","page":"1124-1137","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Adipose‐derived mesenchymal stem cells ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis via modulation of Th1/Th17 and expansion of Th2/Treg responses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbin.12171","volume":"48"},{"id":"zegallaiTafazzinDeficiencyMouse2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zegallai","given":"Hana M."},{"family":"Abu‐El‐Rub","given":"Ejlal"},{"family":"Olayinka‐Adefemi","given":"Folayemi"},{"family":"Cole","given":"Laura K."},{"family":"Sparagna","given":"Genevieve C."},{"family":"Marshall","given":"Aaron J."},{"family":"Hatch","given":"Grant M."}],"citation-key":"zegallaiTafazzinDeficiencyMouse2022","container-title":"The FASEB Journal","container-title-short":"The FASEB Journal","DOI":"10.1096/fj.202200145R","ISSN":"0892-6638, 1530-6860","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tafazzin deficiency in mouse mesenchymal stem cells promote reprogramming of activated B lymphocytes toward immunosuppressive phenotypes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fj.202200145R","volume":"36"},{"id":"zeinaliDiosgeninAmelioratesCellular2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeinali","given":"Hossein"},{"family":"Baluchnejadmojarad","given":"Tourandokht"},{"family":"Roghani","given":"Mehrdad"}],"citation-key":"zeinaliDiosgeninAmelioratesCellular2021","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2021.103211","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"language":"en","page":"103211","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Diosgenin ameliorates cellular and molecular changes in multiple sclerosis in C57BL/6 mice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034821004788","volume":"55"},{"id":"zeitlerInhibitionTubulinDetyrosination2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeitler","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Leibinger","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Dietmar"}],"citation-key":"zeitlerInhibitionTubulinDetyrosination2024","container-title":"Neural Regeneration Research","DOI":"10.4103/NRR.NRR-D-23-02015","ISSN":"1673-5374, 1876-7958","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12]]},"language":"en","page":"2557-2558","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Inhibition of tubulin detyrosination: a novel strategy to promote central nervous system regeneration","title-short":"Inhibition of tubulin detyrosination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/10.4103/NRR.NRR-D-23-02015","volume":"19"},{"id":"zengGWASHighlightsNeuronal2024","abstract":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease affecting the brain and spinal cord.

This article addresses this research gap. It offers a literature overview and reports about an empirical study on AI in communications, presenting first insights on how professionals in the field assess the technology. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative cross-national study among 2,689 European communication practitioners investigated four research questions: RQ1 – How much do professionals know about AI and to what extent are they already using AI technologies in their everyday lives? RQ2 – How do professionals rate the impact of AI on communication management? RQ3 – Which challenges do professionals identify for implementing AI in communication management? RQ4 – Which risks do they perceive? Findings Communication professionals revealed a limited understanding of AI and expected the technology to impact the profession as a whole more than the way their organisations or themselves work. Lack of individual competencies and organisations struggling with different levels of competency and unclear responsibilities were identified as key challenges and risks. Research limitations/implications The results highlight the need for communication managers to educate themselves and their teams about the technology and to identify the implementation of AI as a leadership issue.

Our previous studies in an MS mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), demonstrated that major histocompatibility complex Class II constructs can reverse clinical signs of EAE. These constructs block binding and downstream signaling of macrophage migration inhibitory factors (MIF-1/2) through CD74, thereby inhibiting phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and tissue inflammation and promoting remyelination. To directly assess the effects of a novel third generation construct, DRhQ, on axon integrity in EAE, we compared axon conduction properties using electrophysiology on corpus callosum slices and optic nerves. By using two distinct white matter (WM) tracts, we aimed to assess the impact of the EAE and the benefit of DRhQ on myelinated and unmyelinated axons as well as to test the clinical value of DRhQ on demyelinating lesions in CC and optic myelitis. Our study found that EAE altered axon excitability, delayed axon conduction and slowed spatiotemporal summation correlated with diffuse astrocyte and microglia activation. Because MS predisposes patients to stroke, we also investigated and showed that vulnerability to WM ischemia is increased in the EAE MS mouse model. Treatment with DRhQ after the onset of EAE drastically inhibited microglial and astrocyte activation, improved functional integrity of the myelinated axons and enhanced recovery after ischemia. These results demonstrate that DRhQ administered after the onset of EAE promotes WM integrity and function, and reduces subsequent vulnerability to ischemic injury, suggesting important therapeutic potential for treatment of progressive MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zerimech","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Hung"},{"family":"Vandenbark","given":"Arthur A."},{"family":"Offner","given":"Halina"},{"family":"Baltan","given":"Selva"}],"citation-key":"zerimechNovelTherapeuticMultiple2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Molecular Medicine","container-title-short":"Front.

Bu Shen Yi Sui capsule (BSYS) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that has shown antineuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects in treating multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Microglia play an important role in neuroinflammation. The M1 phenotype of microglia is involved in the proinflammatory process of the disease, while the M2 phenotype plays an anti‐inflammatory role.

BSYS treatment of EAE mice increased the body weight, decreased the clinical score, and reduced demyelination induced by inflammatory infiltration.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS) primarily hallmarked by neuroinflammation and demyelination. The activation of astrocytes exerts double-edged sword effects, which perform an integral function in demyelination and remyelination. In this research, we examined the therapeutic effects of the Bu Shen Yi Sui capsule (BSYS), a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, in a cuprizone- (CPZ-) triggered demyelination model of MS (CPZ mice). This research intended to evaluate if BSYS might promote remyelination by shifting A1 astrocytes to A2 astrocytes. Methods. The effects of BSYS on astrocyte polarization and the potential mechanisms were explored in vitro and in vivo utilizing real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. Histopathology, expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-1β, and IL-6), growth factors (TGF-β, BDNF), and motor coordination were assessed to verify the effects of BSYS (3.02 g/kg/d) on CPZ mice. In vitro, A1 astrocytes were induced by TNF-α (30 ng/mL), IL-1α (3 ng/mL), and C1q (400 ng/mL), following which the effect of BSYS-containing serum (concentration of 15%) on the transformation of A1/A2 reactive astrocytes was also evaluated. Results and Conclusions. BSYS treatment improved motor function in CPZ mice as assessed by rotarod tests. Intragastric administration of BSYS considerably lowered the proportion of A1 astrocytes, but the number of A2 astrocytes, MOG+, PLP+, CNPase+, and MBP+ cells was upregulated. Meanwhile, dysregulation of glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase was reversed in CPZ mice after treatment with BSYS. In addition, the lesion area and expression of proinflammatory cytokines were decreased and neuronal protection factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines were increased. In vitro, BSYS-containing serum suppressed the A1 astrocytic markers’ expression and elevated the expression levels of A2 markers in primary astrocytes triggered by C1q, TNF-α, and IL-1α. Importantly, the miR-155/SOCS1 signaling pathway was involved in the modulation of the A1/A2 phenotype shift. Overall, this study demonstrated that BSYS has neuroprotective effects in myelin repair by modulating astrocyte polarization via the miR-155/SOCS1 pathway.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zha","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yi-Jiang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Si-Si"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jun-Ling"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Fang"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Liang-Yun"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Yong-Ping"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lei"}],"citation-key":"zhaBuShenYi2022","container-title":"Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity","container-title-short":"Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity","DOI":"10.1155/2022/3800004","editor":[{"family":"Birla","given":"Hareram"}],"ISSN":"1942-0994, 1942-0900","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1-22","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bu Shen Yi Sui Capsule Promotes Myelin Repair by Modulating the Transformation of A1/A2 Reactive Astrocytes In Vivo and In Vitro","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2022/3800004/","volume":"2022"},{"id":"zhaiHighefficiencyBraintargetedIntranasal2022","abstract":"The schematic illustration of the effect of the brain-targeted engineered exosome-mediated BDNF on oligodendrocyte differentiation\n              in vitro\n              and remyelination\n              in vivo\n              through intranasal administration.\n            \n          , \n            \n              The regeneration of myelin sheaths is the ultimate goal of the treatment of demyelination disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS).

Lifestyle factors are also associated with AD risk and may interact with APOE to influence neuroimaging biomarkers. However, evidence on these interactions remains limited and inconsistent, particularly regarding composite healthy lifestyle scores in large-scale cohorts.Methods We analyzed neuroimaging data from 21,014 UK Biobank participants (mean age: 55) to examine neuroimaging markers relevant to AD and assess the independent and interactive effects of APOE ε2/ ε4 dosage and healthy lifestyle risk factors. These biomarkers included diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics-fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden, and volumetric measures of medial temporal lobe regions such as the entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal region, amygdala, and hippocampus.Results In the APOE dosage model, ε4 dosage was associated with lower bilateral hippocampal volume, left parahippocampal volume and lower WM integrity, particularly in the posterior thalamic radiation and cingulum-hippocampus and sagittal stratum. A higher healthy lifestyle score was broadly associated with lower WMH burden and higher WM integrity. No statistically significant evidence was found for effect modification by lifestyle on the association between APOE and MRI markers.Conclusions Our results do not provide support for the idea that healthy lifestyle factors buffer or mitigate the detrimental effects of the APOE dosage on MRI markers, but rather support a primarily outright association between APOE ε4 dosage and worse MRI markers.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding Statement: Author Y.

It has been reported that Hippo/yes-associated protein (YAP) pathways are involved in cholesterol synthesis in the liver, however, it remains unknown whether YAP signaling can prevent the demyelination through promoting cholesterol synthesis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a commonly used animal model of multiple sclerosis characterized by neuroinflammation and demyelination. Here, we found that YAP was upregulated and activated in astrocytes of spinal cords of EAE mice through suppression of the Hippo pathway. YAP deletion in astrocytes aggravated EAE with earlier onset, severer inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and more loss of neurons. Furthermore, we found that the neuroinflammation was aggravated and the proliferation of astrocytes was decreased in YAP\n              GFAP\n              -CKO EAE mice.

Interestingly, upregulation of cholesterol-synthesis pathways by diarylpropionitrile (DPN) (an ERβ-ligand, to upregulate the expression of HMGCS1) treatment partially rescued the demyelination deficits in YAP\n              GFAP\n              -CKO EAE mice. Finally, activation of YAP by XMU-MP-1 treatment promoted the expression of HMGCS1 in astrocytes and partially rescued the demyelination and inflammatory infiltration deficits in EAE mice. These findings identify unrecognized functions of astrocytic YAP in the prevention of demyelination through promoting cholesterol synthesis in EAE, and reveal a novel pathway of YAP/HMGCS1 for cholesterol synthesis in EAE pathology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jingjing"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Xingxing"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Huitao"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Lingting"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Xiya"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Changnan"},{"family":"Xiang","given":"Weiwei"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Danlu"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Wenjin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiaojiao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Mianxian"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Tianyingying"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Haoyu"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Lihao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Zhihui"}],"citation-key":"zhangAstrocyticYAPPrevents2021","container-title":"Cell Death & Disease","container-title-short":"Cell Death Dis","DOI":"10.1038/s41419-021-04203-8","ISSN":"2041-4889","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,5]]},"language":"en","page":"907","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Astrocytic YAP prevents the demyelination through promoting expression of cholesterol synthesis genes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-021-04203-8","volume":"12"},{"id":"zhangEml1PromotesAxonal2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yufang"},{"family":"Guan","given":"Tuchen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Beibei"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Xiaoqian"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Longyu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Mingxuan"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Man"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Mei"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yan"}],"citation-key":"zhangEml1PromotesAxonal2024","container-title":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research","container-title-short":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbamcr.2024.119770","ISSN":"01674889","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10]]},"language":"en","page":"119770","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Eml1 promotes axonal growth by enhancing αTAT1-mediated microtubule acetylation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167488924001137","volume":"1871"},{"id":"zhangExosomesDerivedBone2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Buller","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zheng Gang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Mei"},{"family":"Rosene","given":"Douglas L."},{"family":"Medalla","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Tara L."},{"family":"Chopp","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"zhangExosomesDerivedBone2022","container-title":"Experimental Neurology","container-title-short":"Experimental Neurology","DOI":"10.1016/j.expneurol.2021.113895","ISSN":"00144886","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","page":"113895","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells promote remyelination and reduce neuroinflammation in the demyelinating central nervous system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014488621003034","volume":"347"},{"id":"zhangHighMCTBasedKetogenic2024","abstract":"Scope\n              Inflammation and pyroptosis play important roles in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

It is also beneficial in reducing the neurological impairment and neuroinflammation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a classic model for multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether HupA can directly regulate oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation and promote remyelination has not been investigated previously. In this study, we have analyzed the potential protective effects of HupA on the demylination model of MS induced by cuprizone (CPZ). It was found that HupA significantly attenuated anxiety-like behavior, as well as augmented motor and cognitive functions in CPZ mice. It also decreased demyelination and axonal injury in CPZ mice. Moreover, in CPZ mice, HupA increased mRNA levels of the various anti-inflammatory cytokines (Arg1, CD206) while reducing the levels of different pro-inflammatory cytokines (iNOS, IL-1β, IL-18, CD16, and TNF-α). Mecamylamine, a nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor antagonist, could effectively reverse the effects of HupA.

Manual therapies have been proven to relieve pain, strengthen muscles, and improve bladder and bowel problems with a high safety and low adverse event profile. Previous studies have reported the results of manual therapy in alleviating symptoms associated with MS, but the conclusions were controversial. Objective: The purpose of this meta-analysis is to comprehensively analyze and determine the efficacy and safety of manual therapy in relieving symptoms associated with MS. Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched from inception of the database to April 30, 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using manual therapy in patients to relieve symptoms associated with MS were considered eligible for this study. Two reviewers independently extracted data using pre-established standards. Results: Finally, 10 eligible RCTs with 631 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. These data establish that massage therapy can significantly ameliorate fatigue, pain, and spasms, while reflexology was only effective in relieving pain in MS patients. No adverse events were reported in eligible RCTs. Conclusions: The present study provides strong evidence that massage therapy could alleviate fatigue, pain, and spasms in MS patients, while reflexology plays a positive role in relieving pain. Physicians could consider massage therapy or reflexology as a safe and effective complementary and alternative treatment. Larger RCTs with higher methodological quality are needed in the future, which aim to provide more meaningful evidence for further proof of efficacy.","author":[{"literal":"Zhang T"},{"literal":"Yan H X"},{"literal":"An Y"},{"literal":"Yin L"},{"literal":"Sun P P"},{"literal":"Zhao J N"},{"literal":"Yan J T"}],"citation-key":"zhangtEfficacySafetyManual2022","container-title":"J Integr Complement Med","DOI":"10.1089/jicm.2021.0382","ISSN":"2768-3605 (Print) 2768-3605","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"780-790","title":"The efficacy and safety of manual therapy for symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1089/jicm.2021.0382","volume":"28"},{"id":"zhao4OctylItaconateAttenuates2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lin-Jie"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qiu-Xia"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Li"}],"citation-key":"zhao4OctylItaconateAttenuates2024","container-title":"Inflammation","container-title-short":"Inflammation","DOI":"10.1007/s10753-024-02050-1","ISSN":"1573-2576","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,18]]},"language":"en","page":"151-164","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"4-Octyl Itaconate Attenuates Neuroinflammation in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis Via Regulating Microglia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10753-024-02050-1","volume":"48"},{"id":"zhaoAstragalusPolysaccharidesPromote2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Jinyun"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Guiqing"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuanhua"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Hua"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Xiaodong"}],"citation-key":"zhaoAstragalusPolysaccharidesPromote2024","container-title":"International Immunopharmacology","container-title-short":"International Immunopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2023.111303","ISSN":"15675769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","page":"111303","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Astragalus polysaccharides promote neural stem cells-derived oligodendrogenesis through attenuating CD8+T cell infiltration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567576923016302","volume":"126"},{"id":"zhaoInvolvementMicroRNA155Mechanism2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Han","given":"Xudong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yanping"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Jiayu"},{"family":"Lei","given":"Yanting"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Qingfei"},{"family":"Mu","given":"Lili"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jinghua"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Guangyou"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xijun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tongshuai"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yao"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yumei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Hulun"}],"citation-key":"zhaoInvolvementMicroRNA155Mechanism2021","container-title":"International Immunopharmacology","container-title-short":"International Immunopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107811","ISSN":"15675769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"en","page":"107811","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Involvement of microRNA-155 in the mechanism of electroacupuncture treatment effects on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567576921004471","volume":"97"},{"id":"zhaoNoseBrainDelivery2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Lixue"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Xiaolu"},{"family":"Ni","given":"Shuting"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Mei"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Kaili"}],"citation-key":"zhaoNoseBrainDelivery2023","container-title":"International Journal of Pharmaceutics","container-title-short":"International Journal of Pharmaceutics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijpharm.2023.123351","ISSN":"03785173","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","page":"123351","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Nose to brain delivery of Astragaloside IV by β-Asarone modified chitosan nanoparticles for multiple sclerosis therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378517323007718","volume":"644"},{"id":"zhaoRegulatoryGenomicCircuitry2025","abstract":"Brain age gap (BAG) is a valuable biomarker for evaluating brain healthy status and detecting age-associated cognitive degeneration.

Here, we estimate brain age from magnetic resonance imaging with improved accuracy using our proposed adversarial convolution network (ACN), followed by applying the ACN model to an elder cohort from UK Biobank. The genetic heritability of BAG is significantly enriched in the regulatory regions and implicated in glial cells. We prioritize a set of BAG-associated genes, and further characterize their expression patterns across brain cell types and regions. Two BAG-associated genes, RUNX2 and KLF3, are found as associated with epigenetic clock and diverse aging-related biological pathways. Finally, two BAG-associated hub transcription factors, KLF3 and SOX10, are identified as regulators of pleiotropic risk genes from diverse brain disorders. Altogether, we improve the estimation of BAG, and identify BAG-associated genes and regulatory networks that are implicated in brain disorders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was partly supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (T2225015, 61932008), Shanghai Science and Technology Commission Program (23JS1410100, 24JS2810100), Hainan Province Science and Technology Special Fund (ZDYF2024SHFZ058), National Key R&amp;D Program of China (2023YFF1204800, 2020YFA0712403), Lingang Laboratory &amp; National Key Laboratory of Human Factors Engineering Joint Grant (LG-TKN-202203-01), and Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (21ZR1408100).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Wayne Xin"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Junyi"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Tianyi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaolei"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Yupeng"},{"family":"Min","given":"Yingqian"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Beichen"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Junjie"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Zican"},{"family":"Du","given":"Yifan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yushuo"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhipeng"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Jinhao"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Ruiyang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yifan"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Xinyu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zikang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Peiyu"},{"family":"Nie","given":"Jian-Yun"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Ji-Rong"}],"citation-key":"zhaoSurveyLargeLanguage2025","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2303.18223","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,11]]},"number":"arXiv:2303.18223","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Survey of Large Language Models","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18223"},{"id":"zhaoTeriflunomidePromotesBlood2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yipeng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Xiuqing"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Xi"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Yanyu"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Fuhua"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jingqi"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Shishi"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shilin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yiying"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Linli"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Wei"}],"citation-key":"zhaoTeriflunomidePromotesBlood2024","container-title":"Molecular Neurobiology","container-title-short":"Mol Neurobiol","DOI":"10.1007/s12035-023-03655-7","ISSN":"0893-7648, 1559-1182","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4]]},"language":"en","page":"1936-1952","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Teriflunomide Promotes Blood–Brain Barrier Integrity by Upregulating Claudin-1 via the Wnt/β-catenin Signaling Pathway in Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12035-023-03655-7","volume":"61"},{"id":"zhengAlleviationExperimentalAutoimmune2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Lingling"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Caiyun"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Fengna"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shan"},{"family":"Mi","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Tao"}],"citation-key":"zhengAlleviationExperimentalAutoimmune2024","container-title":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease","container-title-short":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbadis.2023.166934","ISSN":"09254439","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2]]},"language":"en","page":"166934","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Alleviation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by transferring low RelB expression tolerogenic dendritic cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0925443923003009","volume":"1870"},{"id":"zhengPrmt5DeficiencyInhibits2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (Prmt5) is the main type II methyltransferase, catalyzes protein arginine residue symmetric dimethylation, and modulates normal cellular physiology and disease progression.

It does not usually respond to first‐line drug treatments (e.g. propranolol, primidone, anticholinergics, gabapentin and clonazepam) due to side effects and frequent dose limitations. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT‐A) has been widely used to treat tremor, but its efficacy and safety are uncertain. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of BoNT‐A in the treatment of hand tremor. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library databases for relevant randomised controlled trials of the effects of BoNT‐A injections on tremors, up to 20 February 2020. A meta‐analysis of comparative effects was performed using R studio software, and publication bias was examined using Egger's test. RESULTS: Six studies examining a total of 245 participants with tremor were included in the meta‐analysis. The primary outcome of meta‐analysis showed no difference in clinical tremor scale scores between the BoNT‐A group versus the placebo group (standardised mean difference (SMD): ‐0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): ‐1.94 to 1.10; I2 = 96%). For clinical tremor scale scores, subgroup analyses suggested that the BoNT‐A group may differ in terms of multiple sclerosis (MS) related tremor (SMD: ‐1.10; 95% CI: ‐2.17 to ‐0.04; I2 = 79%) compared to a placebo, but the difference did not exist in the outcome of essential tremor (ET) or hand tremor (MD: ‐1.31; 95% CI: ‐3.39; 1.31; I2 = 97%). Grip strength (MD: ‐1.25, 95% CI: ‐5.99 to 3.50, I2 = 97%) was slightly lower in the BoNT‐A group, but the difference was not significant. The incidence of adverse events (AEs), including hand weakness (RR: 2.96, 95% CI: 1.40 to 6.24, I2 = 37%), was significantly greater in the BoNT‐A group than in the placebo group. Two studies were assessed as having an overall low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that BoNT‐A injections are unlikely to have an impact on patients with hand tremors. However, subgroup analysis suggested that BoNT‐A injections could have possible benefits in MS‐related tremor. While moderate to severe hand weakness AEs often limits their use in clinical practice, additional well‐designed double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials are needed to provide more robust conclusions.","author":[{"literal":"Zheng X"},{"literal":"Wei W"},{"literal":"Liu P"},{"literal":"Wu C"},{"literal":"Lu L"},{"literal":"Tang C"}],"citation-key":"zhengxBotulinumToxinType2020","container-title":"Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska","DOI":"10.5603/PJNNS.a2020.0079","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"561‐567","title":"Botulinum toxin type A for hand tremor: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.viamedica.pl/neurologia_neurochirurgia_polska/article/view/PJNNS.a2020.0079/52192","volume":"54"},{"id":"zhiduTranslationalPotentialMesenchymal2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhidu","given":"Song"},{"family":"Ying","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Rui","given":"Jiang"},{"family":"Chao","given":"Zhang"}],"citation-key":"zhiduTranslationalPotentialMesenchymal2024","container-title":"Stem Cell Research & Therapy","container-title-short":"Stem Cell Res Ther","DOI":"10.1186/s13287-024-03885-z","ISSN":"1757-6512","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,26]]},"language":"en","page":"266","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Translational potential of mesenchymal stem cells in regenerative therapies for human diseases: challenges and opportunities","title-short":"Translational potential of mesenchymal stem cells in regenerative therapies for human diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-024-03885-z","volume":"15"},{"id":"zhongTargetedTherapyMultiple2024","abstract":"Multiple sclerosis is an autoinflammatory condition that results in damage to myelinated neurons in affected patients.

Similarly, there is currently no effective treatment for patients with primary progressive MS. Innate and adaptive immune cells in the CNS play a critical role in initiating an autoimmune attack and in maintaining the chronic inflammation that drives disease progression. In this review, we will focus on recent insights into the role of T cells with regulatory function in suppressing the progression of MS, and, more importantly, in promoting the remyelination and repair of MS lesions in the CNS. We will discuss the exciting potential to genetically reprogram regulatory T cells to achieve immune suppression and enhance repair locally at sites of tissue damage, while retaining a fully competent immune system outside the CNS. In the future, reprogramed regulatory T cells with defined specificity and function may provide life medicines that can persist in patients and achieve lasting disease suppression after one cycle of treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhong","given":"Yiya"},{"family":"Stauss","given":"Hans J."}],"citation-key":"zhongTargetedTherapyMultiple2024","container-title":"Cells","container-title-short":"Cells","DOI":"10.3390/cells13100797","ISSN":"2073-4409","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,8]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"797","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Targeted Therapy of Multiple Sclerosis: A Case for Antigen-Specific Tregs","title-short":"Targeted Therapy of Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/13/10/797","volume":"13"},{"id":"zhouNeuroprotectiveEffectsNovel2024","abstract":"Purpose:\n              The interaction between inflammatory cells and integrin in the endothelium plays a key role during infiltration.

Diminished inflammatory disease activity (DA) as people with MS (pwMS) age motivated randomized clinical trials assessing disease-modifying therapy (DMT) discontinuation in older pwMS given the concern for risks outweighing benefits. This study aims to examine whether peripheral production of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP)-driven cytokine responses mediate the aging-associated decline in MS inflammatory DA.Methods We included the clinical data of 669 adult pwMS between 2017 and 2022 who enrolled in a clinic-based prospective cohort. From a subset of 80 participants, we isolated fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cultured with 50μg/ml of MBP (or heat-killed Candida) for 24 hours. We assayed cell culture supernatants for interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and a subset of the supernatant samples using a commercial human cytokine/chemokine array. We examined the associations between age and annualized relapse rate (ARR) as well as between age and MBP-stimulated cytokine production (by cultured PBMC) using covariate-adjusted linear regressions. We performed mediation analyses to determine the extent to which MBP-driven cytokine response drives the association between age and ARR.Results Among 669 pwMS (mean age 51.7±12.7 years, 80.7% women, 89.4% non-Hispanic White), ARR declined with age (β=-0.003, p&lt;0.001). Among the subgroup of 80 pwMS whose cultured PBMCs underwent ex vivo MBP stimulation, IL-17 production declined with age in women (β=-0.27, p=0.04) but not men (β=-0.1, p=0.73). MBP-driven IL-17 response partially mediated the association between older age and lower ARR (24.7% in women, 15.3% in men). In exploratory analyses, older pwMS (≥50 years) had marginally lower (IL-4, MCP-2, MCP-3, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB) and higher (Fractalkine, MDC) concentrations of several cytokines than younger pwMS (&lt;50 years), while certain cytokines (MCP-2, MDC) mediated whereas others negated the effect of age on ARR.Conclusion Diminished peripheral IL-17 response as a potential biological mechanism underlying the aging-dependent decline in MS inflammatory DA warrants further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by NINDS-R01NS098023 NINDS-R01NS124882 (Xia).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The institutional review boards of the University of Pittsburgh gave ethical approval for this work (STUDY19080007).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

The results show that stemazole enhanced the survival rate and the number of clone formation in a dose-dependent manner and decreased the percentage of cell apoptosis. In particular, the number of cell clones was increased up to 6-fold (p < 0.001) in the stemazole group compared with the control group. In vivo, we assessed the effect of stemazole on recovering the motor dysfunction and demyelination induced by cuprizone (CPZ). The results show that stemazole promoted the recovery of motor dysfunction and the repair of myelin sheaths. Compared with the CPZ group, the stemazole group showed a 30.46% increase in the myelin area (p < 0.001), a 37.08% increase in MBP expression (p < 0.01), and a 1.66-fold increase in Olig2 expression (p < 0.001).

This leads to neurological dysfunction, including hand impairment, which is prevalent among patients with MS. However, hand impairment is the least targeted area for neurorehabilitation studies. Therefore, this study proposes a novel approach to improve hand functions compared to current strategies. Studies have shown that learning new skills in the motor cortex (M1) can trigger the production of oligodendrocytes and myelin, which is a critical mechanism for neuroplasticity. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used to enhance motor learning and function in human subjects. However, tDCS induces non-specific effects, and concurrent behavioral training has been found to optimize its benefits. Recent research indicates that applying tDCS during motor learning can have priming effects on the long-term potentiation mechanism and prolong the effects of motor training in health and disease. Therefore, this study aims to assess whether applying repeated tDCS during the learning of a new motor skill in M1 can be more effective in improving hand functions in patients with MS than current neurorehabilitation strategies. If this approach proves successful in improving hand functions in patients with MS, it could be adopted as a new approach to restore hand functions. Additionally, if the application of tDCS demonstrates an accumulative effect in improving hand functions in patients with MS, it could provide an adjunct intervention during rehabilitation for these patients. This study will contribute to the growing body of literature on the use of tDCS in neurorehabilitation and could have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients with MS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zoghi","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Jaberzadeh","given":"Shapour"}],"citation-key":"zoghiStepRestoringHand2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Rehabilitation Sciences","container-title-short":"Front.

In this illness, the immune system plays an essential role in its pathophysiology and progression. The currently available treatments are not recognized as curable options and, at best, might slow the progression of MS injuries to the CNS. However, stem cell treatment has provided a new avenue for treating MS. Stem cells may enhance CNS healing and regulate immunological responses. Likewise, stem cells can come from various sources, including adipose, neuronal, bone marrow, and embryonic tissues. Choosing the optimal cell source for stem cell therapy is still a difficult verdict. A type of stem cell known as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is obtainable from different sources and has a strong immunomodulatory impact on the immune system. According to mounting data, the umbilical cord and adipose tissue may serve as appropriate sources for the isolation of MSCs. Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs), as novel stem cell sources with immune-regulatory effects, regenerative properties, and decreased antigenicity, can also be thought of as a new upcoming contender for MS treatment. Overall, the administration of stem cells in different sets of animal and clinical trials has shown immunomodulatory and neuroprotective results. Therefore, this review aims to discuss the different types of stem cells by focusing on MSCs and their mechanisms, which can be used to treat and improve the outcomes of MS disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zolfaghari Baghbadorani","given":"Parnian"},{"family":"Rayati Damavandi","given":"Amirmasoud"},{"family":"Moradi","given":"Samira"},{"family":"Ahmadi","given":"Meysam"},{"family":"Bemani","given":"Peyman"},{"family":"Aria","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Mottedayyen","given":"Hossein"},{"family":"Rayati Damavandi","given":"Amirhossein"},{"family":"Eskandari","given":"Nahid"},{"family":"Fathi","given":"Farshid"}],"citation-key":"zolfagharibaghbadoraniCurrentAdvancesStem2023","container-title":"Reviews in the Neurosciences","DOI":"10.1515/revneuro-2022-0102","ISSN":"0334-1763, 2191-0200","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"language":"en","page":"613-633","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Current advances in stem cell therapy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/revneuro-2022-0102/html","volume":"34"},{"id":"zornerPrognosisWalkingFunction2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zörner","given":"Björn"},{"family":"Hostettler","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Killeen","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Gut","given":"Pauline"},{"family":"Linnebank","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Weller","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Straumann","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Filli","given":"Linard"}],"citation-key":"zornerPrognosisWalkingFunction2022","container-title":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","container-title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders","DOI":"10.1016/j.msard.2022.103802","ISSN":"22110348","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"language":"en","page":"103802","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Prognosis of walking function in multiple sclerosis supported by gait pattern analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211034822003145","volume":"63"},{"id":"zouAnemosideB4Ameliorates2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zou","given":"Min"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Fang-jun"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Li-rong"},{"family":"Han","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chang-yin"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Shi-shi"},{"family":"Tomlinson","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yan-hong"}],"citation-key":"zouAnemosideB4Ameliorates2022","container-title":"European Journal of Pharmacology","container-title-short":"European Journal of Pharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejphar.2022.175185","ISSN":"00142999","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"en","page":"175185","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Anemoside B4 ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice by modulating inflammatory responses and the gut microbiota","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014299922004460","volume":"931"},{"id":"zoulTaiChiHealth2017","abstract":"The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the existing evidence on the effectiveness and safety of Tai chi, which is critical to provide guidelines for clinicians to improve symptomatic management in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

In this study, we aimed to vascularize the repaired nerve in a single session by establishing a connection between the epineurium of the repaired median nerve and the tunica adventitia of the brachial artery.\n            Methods The technique was performed on the median nerves of a total of 42 rats over 13 weeks. While group 1 didn't receive any intervention, the following three groups (2, 3, and 4) received classic treatments (coaptation, graft, and vein conduit). In addition to classic treatments, the other three groups (5, 6, and 7) were vascularized by attaching the adventitia of the brachial artery to the repaired nerves. Nerve regeneration was evaluated using functional tests, immunohistochemical analysis, and electron microscope.\n            Results The vascularized groups (5, 6, and 7) showed earlier functional recovery (p < 0.05). Vascularization reduced inflammation in the coaptation group, reduced fibrosis and degeneration in the nerve graft group, and reduced fibrosis, degeneration and disorganization while increased the number of passing fibers and myelination in the vein conduit group (p < 0.05). Vascularization provided superior ultrastructural findings. Microscopic analysis revealed a novel finding of “zone of neurovascular interaction” between the adventitia and the regenerating nerve.\n            Conclusion Vascularizing the repaired nerves with this new technique provided faster functional and better histological healing. Unlike classic vascularization techniques, this method does not require microsurgical anastomosis, does not carry the risk of thrombosis, and does not necessitate secondary operations. The “zone of neurovascular interaction” identified in this study revealed regenerating axon clusters alongside newly developed blood vessels. This important finding highlights a potential role of the tunica adventitia in nerve regeneration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zuhour","given":"Moath"},{"family":"İnce","given":"Bilsev"},{"family":"Oltulu","given":"Pembe"},{"family":"Gök","given":"Orhan"},{"family":"Tekecik","given":"Zülal"}],"citation-key":"zuhourNewConceptPeripheral2024","container-title":"Journal of Reconstructive Microsurgery","container-title-short":"J Reconstr Microsurg","DOI":"10.1055/a-2491-3447","ISSN":"0743-684X, 1098-8947","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,20]]},"language":"en","page":"a-2491-3447","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A New Concept in Peripheral Nerve Repair: Incorporating the Tunica Adventitia","title-short":"A New Concept in Peripheral Nerve Repair","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/a-2491-3447"},{"id":"zurawskaMultipleSclerosisCircRNA2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zurawska","given":"Anna E."},{"family":"Mycko","given":"Marcin P."},{"family":"Selmaj","given":"Igor"},{"family":"Raine","given":"Cedric S."},{"family":"Selmaj","given":"Krzysztof W."}],"citation-key":"zurawskaMultipleSclerosisCircRNA2021","container-title":"Neurology Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation","container-title-short":"Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm","DOI":"10.1212/NXI.0000000000001041","ISSN":"2332-7812","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"en","page":"e1041","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Multiple Sclerosis: circRNA Profile Defined Reveals Links to B-Cell Function","title-short":"Multiple Sclerosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/NXI.0000000000001041","volume":"8"},{"id":"zveikInterplayInflammationRemyelination2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Multiple sclerosis (MS) therapeutic goals have traditionally been dichotomized into two distinct avenues: immune-modulatory-centric interventions and pro-regenerative strategies.

While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning capabilities.","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2506.06941","note":"arXiv:2506.06941 [cs]","number":"arXiv:2506.06941","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity","title-short":"The Illusion of Thinking","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06941","author":[{"family":"Shojaee","given":"Parshin"},{"family":"Mirzadeh","given":"Iman"},{"family":"Alizadeh","given":"Keivan"},{"family":"Horton","given":"Maxwell"},{"family":"Bengio","given":"Samy"},{"family":"Farajtabar","given":"Mehrdad"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,9]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,18]]},"citation-key":"shojaeeIllusionThinkingUnderstanding2025","library":"My Library","citekey":"shojaeeIllusionThinkingUnderstanding2025"},{"id":"mollickWorkingWizards2025","type":"webpage","abstract":"Verifying magic on the jagged frontier","language":"en","title":"On Working with Wizards","URL":"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-working-with-wizards","author":[{"family":"Mollick","given":"Ethan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,7]]},"citation-key":"mollickWorkingWizards2025","library":"My Library","citekey":"mollickWorkingWizards2025"},{"id":"bregmanMoralAmbitionStop2025","type":"book","abstract":"A GUARDIAN BOOK OF THE SUMMER 2025THE INSTANT SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER'Gives us hope, humour and guidance at a time when all are in short supply' TIMOTHY SNYDER'The rare read that might actually help you become a better person' ADAM GRANTTHE ANTIDOTE TO APATHY FROM THE INTERNATIONALLY BESTSELLING AUTHOR RUTGER BREGMANEvery day we're bombarded with methods, mantras and life hacks that promise us wellness and prosperity - while time and talent remain some of our most squandered resources.

A review of 89,069 global cancer clinical trials registered in the WHO ICTRP between 1999 and December 2022 revealed a cancer clinical trial landscape dominated by high-income countries and focused on pharmacological interventions, with multinational collaboration limited to only 3% of recruiting trials.

In this Review, we summarize the key findings of the WHO global landscape review and discuss strategies to act on these data, which provide critical empirical evidence to inform policy, practice and investment decisions.","container-title":"Nature Medicine","DOI":"10.1038/s41591-025-03926-x","ISSN":"1546-170X","journalAbbreviation":"Nat Med","language":"en","license":"2025 Springer Nature America, Inc.","note":"publisher: Nature Publishing Group","page":"1-12","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The WHO global landscape of cancer clinical trials","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03926-x","author":[{"family":"Casolino","given":"Raffaella"},{"family":"Tatah","given":"Lambed"},{"family":"Charnaud","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Santero","given":"Marilina"},{"family":"Ilbawi","given":"Andrè"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Anna Laura"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,13]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,9]]},"citation-key":"casolinoWHOGlobalLandscape2025","library":"My Library","citekey":"casolinoWHOGlobalLandscape2025"},{"id":"CancerResearchDevelopment","type":"webpage","abstract":"A snapshot of all clinical trials for cancer from 1999-2022","language":"en","title":"Cancer research and development landscape: overview of 1999-2022 period","title-short":"Cancer research and development landscape","URL":"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/B09177","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,13]]},"citation-key":"CancerResearchDevelopment","library":"My Library","citekey":"CancerResearchDevelopment"},{"id":"WHOLandscapeClinical","type":"webpage","language":"en","title":"WHO landscape of clinical trials on cancer","URL":"https://www.who.int/observatories/global-observatory-on-health-research-and-development/monitoring/clinical-trials-on-cancer","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,13]]},"citation-key":"WHOLandscapeClinical","library":"My Library","citekey":"WHOLandscapeClinical"}]
