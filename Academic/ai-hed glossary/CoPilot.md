Microsoft Copilot is a generative [Artificial Intelligence](Artificial%20intelligence%20(AI).md) chatbot developed by Microsoft. Based on Microsoft's Prometheus model, which is based on OpenAI's GPT-4 series of large language models, it was launched in 2023 as Microsoft's main replacement for the discontinued Cortana. The service was introduced in February 2023 under the name Bing Chat, as a built-in feature for Microsoft Bing and Microsoft Edge. Over the course of 2023, Microsoft began to unify the Copilot branding across its various chatbot products, cementing the "copilot" analogy. At its Build 2023 conference, Microsoft announced its plans to integrate Copilot into Windows 11, allowing users to access it directly through the taskbar.
