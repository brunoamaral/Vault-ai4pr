## Description
ML algorithms improve automatically through experience. Techniques include supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning, enabling computers to analyze data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

## Example
Email filtering, fraud detection, and recommendation systems like Netflix.
